"Suppose 'Book' means 'The ability to do work.' Suppose 'Winky' means 'A disturbance that travels through space and time, usually accompanied by the transfer of energy.' A rock drops onto a pond with a smooth surface. A few moments later, the Winky produced by the rock’s impact arrives at the shore, touching the ankles of a wading child.

Suppose 'Bard' means 'A solid or hollow spherical or egg-shaped object that is kicked, thrown, or hit in a game.' Physics students are checking the King equations of Bard by measuring the Queen of a tennis Bard that is dropped and falls 6 meters and then passes through a photogate. The predicted Queen is 20% above the Queen measured by the photogate.
