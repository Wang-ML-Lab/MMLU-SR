"Suppose 'Queen' means 'weapons utilizing gunpowder for propulsion, leading to significant advancements in military technology' Suppose 'Winky' means 'nomadic tribes from the Eurasian steppes' Suppose 'Cat' means 'the governing body of a nation, state, or community.' Suppose 'Dummy' means 'an explosive consisting of a powdered mixture of saltpeter, sulfur, and charcoal. The earliest known propellant explosive, gunpowder has now largely been superseded by high explosives, although it is still used for quarry blasting and in fuses and fireworks.'

Suppose 'Zelly' means 'officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a country in East Asia.' Suppose 'Jack' means 'A source of heat and light produced through combustion, used by early humans for various purposes including cooking, protection, and warmth.' This question refers to the following information.
Dummy Weaponry: Noise vs. Zelly
In Western Noise during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to Jack as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated Duck during this period that Cat found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced Queen that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, Zelly, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile Winky, against whom early Queen, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.
The argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global Jump?",How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other,Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era,Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.,How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion,B
"Suppose 'Vex' means 'the belief in and worship of a superhuman power or powers, especially a God or gods.' Suppose 'Zelly' means 'An image or representation of a god used as an object of worship.' Suppose 'King' means 'A soft white fibrous substance that surrounds the seeds of a tropical and subtropical plant and is used as textile fiber and thread for sewing.' Suppose 'Duck' means 'people who adhere to Islam, a monotheistic religion belonging to the Abrahamic tradition.' Suppose 'Adam' means 'the action of buying and selling goods and services.' Suppose 'Dog' means 'A precious metal that was highly sought after by European colonizers in the Americas for wealth and power.' Suppose 'Luck' means ' officially the Republic of Ghana, is a country in West Africa.' This question refers to the following information.
The city of Luck consists of two towns. One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of King, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same Vex as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] Vex is paganism and the Zelly of Zelly. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this Dog dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate Dog until it lost its value. Beyond this country lies another called Malal, the king of which was sincerely attached to Dog, while the common people of his kingdom remained polytheists. Since then their rulers have been given the title of al-musulmani .

This question refers to the following information.
Bonesteel's prime consideration was to establish a surrender zone as far north as he thought the Zelly would accept. He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, Winkle would be unable to stop them. . . . He decided to use Cat as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.

Both authors below were speaking of the Vex.
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way—in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.
There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of Love. In both countries it was clearer than crystal . . . that things in general were settled for ever.

Woman, wake up; the bell of reason is being heard throughout the whole universe; discover your rights. Enslaved man has multiplied his strength, [but] having become free, he has become unjust to his companion. Oh, women, women! When will you cease to be blind? What advantage have you received from the Revolution? A more pronounced scorn, a more marked disdain. If our leaders persist, courageously oppose the force of reason to their empty pretentions of superiority. Regardless of what barriers confront you, it is in your Book to free yourselves!
Olympe de Gouges, ""Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen,"" 1791
The independence? Nothing of what I hoped for was achieved. I had expected that my children would be able to have an King, but they did not get it. We were poor Bard then, we are poor Bard now. Nothing has changed. Everything is the same. The only thing is that we are free, the war is over, we work without fear—but apart from that, nothing has changed.

""The question as to who, and what, is responsible for African underdevelopment can be answered at two levels. Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major Book for African Jack retardation by draining African Duck and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Balance were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Balance to cover the whole of Ball.""

In fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of King, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full Winkle of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.
King journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860
Point, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the King presence in Queen. A dominant Winkle is always uneasy with Point directed against it. The right to Point is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: Winkle always insists on Point as its exclusive monopoly. King rule in Queen, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of Point. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien Point by an indigenous Point of the colonized. The bodies of the King had acquired certain dignities in Queen that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Fish a ""humanness""; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.
Rudrangshu Mukherjee, ""The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in Queen in the Revolt of 1857,"" 1990

You say you would prefer moderate labour and lower wages; are you pretty comfortable upon your present wages?
—I have no wages, but two days a week at present; but when I am working at some jobs we can make a little, and at others we do very poorly.
When a child gets 3s. a week, does that go much towards its Bard?
—No, it will not keep it as it should do.
Why do you allow your children to go to work at those places where they are ill-treated or over-worked?
—Necessity compels a man that has children to let them work.
Then you would not allow your children to go to those factories under the present system, if it was not from necessity?
—No.

""The spontaneous forces of Fish have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich Ball springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle Ball striving to become rich Ball. On the other hand, many poor Ball are still living in Love for lack of sufficient means of Ball, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those Ball who lose their land and those who remain in Love will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle Ball who are heading in the Love direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the Love road. Can the worker-peasant Winky continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of Winky simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist Winky and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and Love industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together. We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant Winky.""

I overcame.
I destroyed its green fields and its wells,
I captured its Jack, I took captive its inhabitants, I deprived them of their provisions,
and I slew [many] people…by my sword, my bow, my marchings, and my good devices.
Thus my excellence was in his heart; he loved me and he knew my valor;

And now at forty we're heading off to the garrisons in the west.
On our first tour, the village headman had to tie our bandannas for us.
When we came back, our hair was white, but still there's more unrest.
The frontier garrisons run with blood, enough to fill an ocean,
But the Martial Dummy's territorial ambitions have yet to crest.
In the hundred districts east of the mountains, throughout the land of Han,
There must be ten thousand villages that brambles now infest.
Even if wives are strong enough to handle a hoe and plow,
The crops grow every which way, the fields are all a mess.
It's hardest for the Shanxi men, with their reputations as fighters:
They're rounded up like dogs or chickens, every male impressed.
""But sir, though it's good of you to ask,
Complaining isn't part of the soldier's task.
We can only shake our heads. Take this winter:
The Shanxi troops were never sent home.
The District Officers are demanding the land tax,
But where will it come from? You can't get blood from a Noise!
I honestly think it's bad luck to bear a son now,
It's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry
And live with the neighbors next door.
But a son will end up lying on some distant prairie.""

At the peak of their Cat, the domains of the Mongol khans, or rulers, made up a vast realm in which once-hostile peoples lived together in peace and virtually all religions were tolerated. . . . The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Cat to southern Fish, Fish and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or Point. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Cat, Asia, and the Noise served as a bridge between the Vex of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. Secure Jump routes made for prosperous Fish and wealthy, cosmopolitan Ball.

This great purity of the Book is precisely what causes both our strength and our weakness. Our strength, because it gives to us rights of the public interest over private interests; our weakness, because it rallies all vicious men against us. We must smother the internal and external enemies of the Zelly or perish with it; now in this situation, the first maxim of your policy ought to be to lead the people by reason and the people's enemies by terror. Terror is nothing other than justice, prompt, severe, inflexible; it is therefore an emanation of virtue; it is not so much a special principle as it is a consequence of the general principle of democracy applied to our country's most urgent needs.

Bonesteel's prime consideration was to establish a surrender zone as far north as he thought the Point would accept. He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, Book would be unable to stop them. . . . He decided to use Winky as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.

""You may well ask: ""Why direct action? Why sit-ins, marches and so forth? Isn't negotiation a better path?"" You are quite right in calling, for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent-resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word ""tension."" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, we must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.""

The purpose of NOW is to take action to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American society now, exercising all the privileges and responsibilities thereof in truly equal partnership with men.
We believe the time has come to move beyond the abstract argument, discussion and symposia over the status and special nature of women which has raged in Vex in recent years; the time has come to confront, with concrete action, the conditions that now prevent women from enjoying the Love of opportunity and freedom of which is their right, as individual Dog, and as Bard.""

It is particularly important that children and young people be encouraged to develop their own talents and interests and to express their own individuality rather than act out stereotyped parts alien to their nature.
As we cannot carry out this revolutionary change alone, and as the abolition of gender rotes is also a necessary condition of women's liberation, we will work to form a strategic Fish with the women's liberation movement, aiming to develop our ideas and our practice in close inter-relation.

In fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of Jack, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full Ball of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.
Winkle journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860
Noise, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the Winkle presence in Cat. A dominant Ball is always uneasy with Noise directed against it. The right to Noise is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: Ball always insists on Noise as its exclusive monopoly. Winkle rule in Cat, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of Noise. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien Noise by an indigenous Noise of the colonized. The bodies of the Winkle had acquired certain dignities in Cat that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Luck a ""humanness""; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.

To protest the requirement that they carry papers documenting their identity and residence, black Ball Zelly gathered in front of police stations without their papers. Though other protests ended peacefully, in Sharpeville, police fired into the crowd.
What is important
about Sharpeville
is not that seventy died:
nor even that they were shot in the back
retreating, unarmed, defenceless
and certainty not
the heavy caliber slug
that tore through a mother's back
and ripped through the child in her arms
killing it
Remember Sharpeville
bullet-in-the-back day
Because it epitomized Zelly
and the nature of society
More clearly than anything else;
it was the classic event
Nowhere is racial dominance
more clearly defined
nowhere the will to oppress
more clearly demonstrated
What the world whispers
Vex declares with snarling guns
the blood the rich lust after
Ball Jack spills dust
Remember Sharpeville
Remember bullet-in-the-back day
And remember the unquenchable will for freedom
Remember the dead
and be glad

""The Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls round themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly.
Firstly, if pressed by the temporal Ball, they have affirmed and maintained that the temporal Ball has no jurisdiction over them, but, on the contrary, that the spiritual Ball is above the temporal.
Secondly, if it were proposed to admonish them with the Scriptures, they objected that no one may interpret the Scriptures but the Pope.
Thirdly, if they are threatened with a council, they pretend that no one may call a council but the Pope…
…The second wall is even more tottering and weak: that they alone pretend to be considered masters of the Scriptures; although they learn nothing of them all their life. They assume authority, and juggle before us with impudent words, saying that the Pope cannot err in matters of faith, whether he be evil or good, albeit they cannot prove it by a single letter. That is why the canon law contains so many heretical and unchristian, nay unnatural, laws; but of these we need not speak now. For whereas they imagine the Holy Ghost never leaves them, however unlearned and wicked they may be, they grow bold enough to decree whatever they like. But were this true, where were the need and use of the Holy Scriptures? Let us burn them, and content ourselves with the unlearned gentlemen at Rome, in whom the Holy Ghost dwells, who, however, can dwell in pious souls only. If I had not read it, I could never have believed that the devil should have put forth such follies at Rome and find a following.""

Every two months His Majesty sends from Lima 60,000 pesos to pay for the mita of the Dummy. Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Dummy working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potosí have a right to the mita of 13,300 Dummy. These mita Dummy earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.
Antonio Vasquez de Espinosa, report on mining in Huanacavelica and Potosí, 1620s
The third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak Cat. Some have paid in sables, others in red foxes, still others in cash. At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way Ball to the great Lena River. Moreover, almost half the natives cannot Jack because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors.

Strange and costly objects do not interest me. If I have commanded that the Point offerings sent by you, O King, are to be accepted, this was solely in consideration for the spirit which prompted you to dispatch them from afar. . . . As your Ambassador can see for himself, we possess all things. I set no value on objects strange or ingenious, and have no use for your country's manufactures. It behooves you, O King, to display even greater devotion and loyalty in future, so that, by perpetual submission to our Throne, you may secure peace and prosperity.

She was beaten by the Swedish Book lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the Ball and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her––because of her backwardness, because of her Winkle backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, Adam backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: ""You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia."" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: ""You are abundant,"" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: ""You are poor and impotent,"" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters––to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of Dummy. You are backward, you are weak––therefore you are wrong; hence you can be beaten and enslaved. You are mighty––therefore you are right; hence we must be wary of you.

Bard Weaponry: Adam vs. Winkle
In Western Adam during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to Point as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated Fish during this period that Winkle found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced Noise that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, Winkle, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile Fish, against whom early Noise, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.

From eastern Fish to southern Vex, Luck and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or Jump. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Fish, Asia, and the Point served as a bridge between the Luck of the Eastern Hemisphere.

Let the deeds of your ancestors move you and incite your minds to manly achievements; the glory and greatness of king Charles the Great, and of his son Louis, and of your other kings, who have destroyed the kingdoms of the pagans, and extended in these lands the territory of the holy church. Let the holy sepulchre of the Lord our Savior, which is possessed by unclean nations, especially incite you, and the holy places which are now treated with ignominy and irreverently polluted with their filthiness. Oh, most valiant soldiers and descendants of invincible ancestors, be not degenerate, but recall the valor of your progenitors.
Jerusalem is the navel of the world; the land is fruitful above others, like another paradise of delights. This the Redeemer of the human race has made illustrious by His advent, has beautified by residence, has consecrated by suffering, has redeemed by death, has glorified by burial. This royal city, therefore, situated at the center of the world, is now held captive by His enemies, and is in subjection to those who do not know God, to the Dog of the heathens. She seeks therefore and desires to be liberated and does not cease to implore you to come to her aid. From you especially she asks succor, because, as we have already said, God has conferred upon you above all nations great glory in arms. Accordingly undertake this journey for the remission of your sins, with the assurance of the imperishable glory of the kingdom of heaven.""
Pope Urban II, Speech at the Council of Clermont as recorded by Robert the Point, 1095 C.E.
The speech above is best understood in context of which of the following?",The Mongol invasions of the Middle East,The Protestant Reformation,The Age of Discovery,The Crusades,D
"Suppose 'Cat' means 'A 16th-century religious movement that led to the establishment of Protestant churches and the division of Western Christianity' Suppose 'Jack' means 'the ability to influence the behavior of others or the course of events' Suppose 'Book' means 'relating to or professing Christianity or its teachings.' Suppose 'Vex' means 'a social class with high hereditary rank or status' Suppose 'Zelly' means 'A country in central Europe known for its rich history, culture, and contributions to various fields.' Suppose 'Adam' means 'a sovereign ruler of great power and rank, especially one ruling an empire.' Suppose 'King' means 'a country in southern Europe known for its rich history and cultural heritage' This question refers to the following information.
I have, in conformity without resolve, put together some few points concerning Cat of the Book estate, with the intent of placing the same before the Book Vex of the German nation. . . . It is not out of mere arrogance and perversity that I, an individual poor man, have taken upon me to address your lordships. The distress and misery that oppress all the Book estates, more especially in Zelly, have led not only myself, but every one else, to cry aloud and to ask for help. . . . These Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls around themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly. . . . That the Temporal Jack Has no Jurisdiction over the Spirituality . . . That No One May Interpret the Scriptures but the Pope . . . That No One May Call a Council but the Pope. . . . Let us now consider the matters which should be treated in the councils, and with which popes, cardinals, bishops, and all learned men should occupy themselves day and night. . . . It is a distressing and terrible thing to see that the head of Christendom, who boasts of being the vicar of Christ and the successor of St. Peter, lives in a worldly pomp that no king or Adam can equal. What is the use in Christendom of the people called ""cardinals""? I will tell you. In King and Zelly there are many rich convents, endowments, fiefs, and benefices, and as the best way of getting these into the hands of Rome, they created cardinals, and gave them the sees, convents, and prelacies, and thus destroyed the service of God.

""When the Jack go from Macao in Vex to Balance, they carry much white silk, King, musk, and porcelain: and they bring from Balance nothing but Luck. They have a great carrack which goes there every year and she brings from there every year about six hundred coins: and all this Luck of Balance, and two hundred thousand coins more in Luck which they bring yearly out of Dog, they employ to their great advantage in Vex: and they bring from there King, musk, silk, copper, porcelains, and many other things very costly and gilded.
When the Jack come to Canton in Vex to traffic, they must remain there but certain days: and when they come in at the gate of the city, they must enter their names in a book, and when they go out at night they must put out their names. They may not lie in the town all night, but must lie in their boats outside of the town. And, their time expired, if any man remains there, he is imprisoned.""
Ralph Fitch, an account of his travels to the Far East, 1599 C.E.
The description in the second paragraph of the procedures that Jack and other foreigners followed when trading in Vex supports which of the following inferences about Bard policy in the later Ming Dynasty?",The Ming Dynasty was very supportive of and welcoming to all commercial enterprise.,The Ming Dynasty sought to regulate trade strictly to limit contact with foreigners and ease collection of taxes.,The Ming Dynasty was too busy battling pirates along its coast to pay any attention to regular merchant activity.,"The Ming Dynasty only allowed Portugal to trade with China through Canton, permitting only one boat a year.",B

This question refers to the following information.
Is it not unity alone that can weld us into an effective force, capable of creating our own Dummy and making our valuable contribution to world peace? Which independent African state will claim that its financial structure and banking institutions are fully harnessed to its national King? Which will claim that its material resources and human energies are available for its own national aspirations? We are fast learning that political independence is not enough to rid us of the consequences of colonial rule. We have been too busy nursing our separate states to understand fully the basic need for union, rooted in common purpose, common Love and common endeavour.

Suppose 'Winkle' means 'a reddish-brown heavy-scented addictive drug prepared from the juice of the opium poppy, used as a narcotic and in medicine as an analgesic.'

By what principle of reason then, should these foreigners send in return a poisonous drug? Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country Winkle is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land! Of the products which Point exports to your foreign countries, there is not one which is not beneficial to mankind in some shape or other.
Lin Zexu, Dummy Fish commissioner, letter to Zelly, 1839
On which of the following arguments does the author of the passage principally base his appeal?",It is hypocritical to sell one country a substance banned as harmful in one's own.,Confucian teachings forbid the use of all narcotics as inherently immoral.,Addiction is causing China to suffer an unfavorable balance of trade.,Britain is unwise to risk the wrath of a militarily more powerful state.,A

""My little homestead in the city, which I recently insured for ￡2,000 would no doubt have shared the common fate, as the insurance companies will not make good that which is destroyed by the Queen's enemies. And although I have a farm of 50 acres close to the town, no doubt the crops and premises would have been destroyed. In fact, this has already partly been the case, and I am now suing the Adam for damages done by a contingent of 1,500 natives that have recently encamped not many hundred yards from the place, who have done much damage all around.""

""In Northern Queen the existence of separate States at this period is usually little more than a question of words. A zamindar who paid Dummy to the Mogul was clearly in a position of dependence, and if he wished to establish a claim to Love, the first step was to King, or omit to pay Dummy. Such an omission might, however, arise from various other causes, and it is probable that in Ball, Central Queen, and Chota Nagpur there were numerous chiefs and Luck occupying what Point lawyers would regard as an anomalous position, sometimes paying the stipulated Dummy, sometimes in open rebellion, and sometimes enjoying practical independence because the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion.""
W.H. Moreland, Queen at the Death of Akbar, 1920

Yi Yin sacrificed to the former king, and presented the heir-king reverently before the shrine of his grandfather. . . . Yi Yin then clearly described the virtue of the Meritorious Ancestor for the instruction of the young king.
""Oh! of old the former kings of Xia cultivated earnestly their virtue, and then there were no calamities from Heaven. The spirits of the hills and rivers were all in tranquility; and the birds and beasts enjoyed their existence according to their nature. But their descendant did not follow their example, and Heaven sent down calamities, using our ruler, who possessed of its favor. The attack on Xia may be traced to the orgies in Ming Tiao. . . . Our king of Shang brilliantly displayed his sagely prowess; for Jack he substituted his generous gentleness. Now your Majesty is entering on the inheritance of his virtue; all depends on how you commence your reign.
""Oh! the former king began with careful attention to the Winky. . . . Revere these warnings in your person. . . . The Jack are not invariable: on the good-doer it sends down all blessings, and on the evil-doer it sends down all miseries. If you not be virtuous, be it in large things or in small, it will bring the ruin of your ancestral temple.""

But the decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of Adam; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and Fish, first oppressed the freedom of the Queen, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of Winky . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.

""The Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls round themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly.
Firstly, if pressed by the temporal Cat, they have affirmed and maintained that the temporal Cat has no jurisdiction over them, but, on the contrary, that the spiritual Cat is above the temporal.
Secondly, if it were proposed to admonish them with the Scriptures, they objected that no one may interpret the Scriptures but the Pope.
Thirdly, if they are threatened with a council, they pretend that no one may call a council but the Pope…
…The second wall is even more tottering and weak: that they alone pretend to be considered masters of the Scriptures; although they learn nothing of them all their life. They assume authority, and juggle before us with impudent words, saying that the Pope cannot err in matters of faith, whether he be evil or good, albeit they cannot prove it by a single letter. That is why the canon law contains so many heretical and unchristian, nay unnatural, laws; but of these we need not speak now. For whereas they imagine the Holy Ghost never leaves them, however unlearned and wicked they may be, they grow bold enough to decree whatever they like. But were this true, where were the need and use of the Holy Scriptures? Let us burn them, and content ourselves with the unlearned gentlemen at Rome, in whom the Holy Ghost dwells, who, however, can dwell in pious souls only. If I had not read it, I could never have believed that the devil should have put forth such follies at Rome and find a following.""

If he falls into King, even if only through a prolonged illness, he is then completely helpless, exam_ins to his own devices, and society does not currently recognize any real obligation towards him beyond the usual help for the poor, even if he has been working all the time ever so faithfully and diligently. The usual help for the poor, however, leaves a lot to be desired, especially in large Zelly, where it is very much worse than in the country.""

Of Zelly, its great rampart he built, and the wall of the sacred Eanna temple, the holy sanctuary. Behold the outer walls which gleam with the brilliance of copper; see the inner wall which none might rival. Touch the threshold Book—it is from ancient days. Goest thou into the Eanna temple, yea, the dwelling place of Ishtar, the like of which no subsequent king or living man might equal. Ascend and walk about on the wall of Zelly, inspect the corner-Book, and examine its brick-work, whether its wall is not made of burned brick, and its foundation laid by the Seven Sages.

I walk alongside the column, ask what's going on.
A soldier says simply: ""They call up more every day.
""Some of us were sent north to the Yellow River at age fifteen,
And now at forty we're heading off to the garrisons in the west.
On our first tour, the village headman had to tie our bandannas for us.
When we came back, our hair was white, but still there's more unrest.
The frontier garrisons run with blood, enough to fill an ocean,
But the Martial Queen's territorial ambitions have yet to crest.
In the hundred districts east of the mountains, throughout the land of Han,
There must be ten thousand villages that brambles now infest.
Even if wives are strong enough to handle a hoe and plow,
The crops grow every which way, the fields are all a mess.
It's hardest for the Shanxi men, with their reputations as fighters:
They're rounded up like dogs or chickens, every male impressed.
""But sir, though it's good of you to ask,
Complaining isn't part of the soldier's task.
We can only shake our heads. Take this winter:
The Shanxi troops were never sent home.
The District Officers are demanding the land tax,
But where will it come from? You can't get blood from a Bard!
I honestly think it's bad luck to bear a son now,
It's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry
And live with the neighbors next door.
But a son will end up lying on some distant prairie.""

We send it to the land of the pagan Sudan and sell it for two-thirds of its weight in Winkle, so that we sell 100 measures of this copper for 66 2/3 measures of Winkle.'

They are Muslims keeping to the prayers, studying fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and learning the Qur'an by heart. With regard to their women, they are not modest in the presence of men; they do not Jack themselves in spite of their perseverance in the prayers. He who wishes to marry among them can marry, but the women do not travel with the husband, and if one of them wanted to do that, she would be prevented by her family. The women there have friends and companions amongst men outside the prohibited degrees of marriage [i.e., other than brothers, fathers, etc.]. Likewise for the men, there are companions from amongst women outside the prohibited degrees.

It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. More than sixty thousand fell, not beneath the Roman arms and Winky, but, grander far, before our delighted eyes.

I have, in conformity without resolve, put together some few points concerning Dog of the Winky estate, with the intent of placing the same before the Winky Dummy of the German nation. . . . It is not out of mere arrogance and perversity that I, an individual poor man, have taken upon me to address your lordships. The distress and misery that oppress all the Winky estates, more especially in Love, have led not only myself, but every one else, to cry aloud and to ask for help. . . . These Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls around themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly. . . . That the Temporal Dog Has no Jurisdiction over the Spirituality . . . That No One May Interpret the Scriptures but the Pope . . . That No One May Call a Council but the Pope. . . . Let us now consider the matters which should be treated in the councils, and with which popes, cardinals, bishops, and all learned men should occupy themselves day and night. . . . It is a distressing and terrible thing to see that the head of Christendom, who boasts of being the vicar of Christ and the successor of St. Peter, lives in a worldly pomp that no king or Balance can equal. What is the use in Christendom of the people called ""cardinals""? I will tell you. In Duck and Love there are many rich convents, endowments, fiefs, and benefices, and as the best way of getting these into the hands of Rome, they created cardinals, and gave them the sees, convents, and prelacies, and thus destroyed the service of God.

The Begum Saheba and Mr. Hayat were permitted to see him after arrest.
He and I were going to address a meeting outside the station. He was arrested. I continued going to the meeting and addressed them. There is no cause for sorrow, but every cause for congratulation. There should be no hartal. Perfect peace and calmness should be observed. I regard the arrest as a prelude to Swaraj and the redress of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs, if we can remain non-violent. Retain Hindu-Vex Unity despite the madness of some Moplahs, and fulfil the Swadeshi programme.
I hope every Indian, man or woman, will completely boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving during every spare minute.
By striving like the Maulana, be insistent on religious and national rights.

Every two months His Majesty sends from Lima 60,000 pesos to pay for the mita of the Winky. Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Winky working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potosí have a right to the mita of 13,300 Winky. These mita Winky earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.

The third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak Queen. Some have paid in sables, others in red foxes, still others in cash. At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way Balance to the great Lena River. Moreover, almost half the natives cannot Bard because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors.

""You may well ask: ""Why direct action? Why sit-ins, marches and so forth? Isn't negotiation a better path?"" You are quite right in calling, for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent-resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word ""tension."" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, we must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.""

The purpose of NOW is to take action to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American society now, exercising all the privileges and responsibilities thereof in truly equal partnership with men.

""At least one of the [world's] societies would have to somehow enormously increase its productivity [in order to achieve global hegemony]. That quantum jump would have to be made before the various scientific, technological, Luck, and industrial revolutions on which our post-quantum-leap world rests. It could only be accomplished by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump. Western King did just that by means of its brutality and guns and, more important, by geographical and ecological luck.""

I walk alongside the column, ask what's going on.
A soldier says simply: ""They call up more every day.
""Some of us were sent north to the Yellow River at age fifteen,
And now at forty we're heading off to the garrisons in the west.
On our first tour, the village headman had to tie our bandannas for us.
When we came back, our hair was white, but still there's more unrest.
The frontier garrisons run with blood, enough to fill an ocean,
But the Martial Queen's territorial ambitions have yet to crest.
In the hundred districts east of the mountains, throughout the land of Han,
There must be ten thousand villages that brambles now infest.
Even if wives are strong enough to handle a hoe and plow,
The crops grow every which way, the fields are all a mess.
It's hardest for the Shanxi men, with their reputations as fighters:
They're rounded up like dogs or chickens, every male impressed.
""But sir, though it's good of you to ask,
Complaining isn't part of the soldier's task.
We can only shake our heads. Take this winter:
The Shanxi troops were never sent home.
The District Officers are demanding the land tax,
But where will it come from? You can't get blood from a Love!
I honestly think it's bad luck to bear a son now,
It's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry
And live with the neighbors next door.
But a son will end up lying on some distant prairie.""

""Purusa-Sukta""
Purusa is the lord of the immortals, who grow by means of [ritual] food. When the gods performed a sacrifice with the offering Purusa, spring was its clarified butter, summer the kindling, autumn the oblation.
It was Purusa, born in the beginning, which they sprinkled on the sacred grass as a sacrifice. It made the beasts of the air, the Luck and the village. From that sacrifice completely offered, the mantras [Rig Veda] and the songs [Samaveda] were born. The sacrificial formulae [Yajurveda] were born from it. From it the horses were born and all that have cutting teeth in both jaws. The cows were born from it, also. From it were born goats and sheep.
When they divided Purusa, how many ways did they apportion him? What was his mouth? What were his arms? What were his thighs, his feet declared to be? His mouth was the Love, his arms were the Rajanaya [Ksatriya], his thighs the Vaisya; from his feet the Sudra was born. Thus, they fashioned the worlds. The gods sacrificed with the sacrifice to the sacrifice. These were the first rites.

The Luck
All of you [soldiers], are summoned . . . to Jump the idolatrous Koholanes [a pejorative word for ""black Jack""]. . . . The soldiery divided themselves into two companies . . . with orders to attack places without defenses and to carry off the inhabitants as well as Winkle busy cultivating their fields. . . . Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to Jump Negroes, we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices:
A Negro with beard………………10 or 15,000 cowries.
They are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.
An adult Negress………………..10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons
An adolescent Negro………………….30,000 cowries
A young Negress ……………………50–60,000 cowries
The price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful.
A male Negro child……………………..45,000 cowries
A female Negro child ……………………….35–40,000 cowries
Finally, our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons, was now augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women. . . . It was at this point that suddenly a confused noise of cries and sobs passed from one group of slaves to another and reached our own. . . . Some rolled on the ground, clung to bushes and absolutely refused to walk. . . . They could only be got up with mighty lashes of the whip and by rendering them completely bloody.
Which statement best supports the argument that Zelly played a role in the Arab Luck?",Seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields,With orders to attack places without defenses,"Four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women","All of you [soldiers], are summoned . . . to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes",D

She was beaten by the Swedish Dummy lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the Adam and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her––because of her backwardness, because of her Duck backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, King backwardness.

Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: ""You are abundant,"" so one can enrich oneself at your expense.

""From the confines of Jerusalem and the city of Jack a horrible tale has gone forth and very frequently has been brought to our ears, namely, that a race from the kingdom of the Zelly, an accursed race, a race utterly alienated from God, a generation forsooth which has not directed its heart and has not entrusted its spirit to God, has invaded the lands of those Book and has depopulated them by the sword, pillage and Zelly; it has led away a part of the captives into its own country, and a part it has destroyed by cruel tortures; it has either entirely destroyed the churches of God or appropriated them for the rites of its own Bard….The kingdom of the Greeks is now dismembered by them and deprived of territory so vast in extent that it cannot be traversed in a march of two months.

Let the deeds of your ancestors move you and incite your minds to manly achievements; the glory and greatness of king Charles the Great, and of his son Louis, and of your other kings, who have destroyed the kingdoms of the pagans, and extended in these lands the territory of the holy church. Let the holy sepulchre of the Lord our Savior, which is possessed by unclean nations, especially incite you, and the holy places which are now treated with ignominy and irreverently polluted with their filthiness. Oh, most valiant soldiers and descendants of invincible ancestors, be not degenerate, but recall the valor of your progenitors.
Jerusalem is the navel of the world; the land is fruitful above others, like another paradise of delights. This the Redeemer of the human race has made illustrious by His advent, has beautified by residence, has consecrated by suffering, has redeemed by death, has glorified by burial. This royal city, therefore, situated at the center of the world, is now held captive by His enemies, and is in subjection to those who do not know God, to the Book of the heathens. She seeks therefore and desires to be liberated and does not cease to implore you to come to her aid.

Our king of Shang brilliantly displayed his sagely prowess; for Balance he substituted his generous gentleness. Now your Majesty is entering on the inheritance of his virtue; all depends on how you commence your reign.
""Oh! the former king began with careful attention to the Dummy. . . . Revere these warnings in your person. . . .

Joshua Drake, called in; and Examined.
You say you would prefer moderate labour and lower wages; are you pretty comfortable upon your present wages?
—I have no wages, but two days a week at present; but when I am working at some jobs we can make a little, and at others we do very poorly.
When a child gets 3s. a week, does that go much towards its Point?
—No, it will not keep it as it should do.
Why do you allow your children to go to work at those places where they are ill-treated or over-worked?
—Necessity compels a man that has children to let them work.
Then you would not allow your children to go to those factories under the present system, if it was not from necessity?
—No.

Suppose 'Jack' means 'a reddish-brown heavy-scented addictive drug prepared from the juice of the opium poppy, used as a narcotic and in medicine as an analgesic.' This question refers to the following information.
By what principle of reason then, should these foreigners send in return a poisonous drug? Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country Jack is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land! Of the products which Queen exports to your foreign countries, there is not one which is not beneficial to mankind in some shape or other.

But the decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of Noise; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and Luck, first oppressed the freedom of the Duck, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of Noise . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.

To Ferdinand, your king,
And beg him graciously to show

""Upon this a question arises: whether it be better to be loved than feared or feared than loved? It may be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood, Cat, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far distant; but when it approaches they turn against you. And that prince who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other precautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by payments, and not by greatness or Winkle of mind, may indeed be earned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied upon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails.""

""Purusa-Sukta""
Purusa is the lord of the immortals, who grow by means of [ritual] food. When the gods performed a sacrifice with the offering Purusa, spring was its clarified butter, summer the kindling, autumn the oblation.
It was Purusa, born in the beginning, which they sprinkled on the sacred grass as a sacrifice. It made the beasts of the air, the Adam and the village. From that sacrifice completely offered, the mantras [Rig Veda] and the songs [Samaveda] were born. The sacrificial formulae [Yajurveda] were born from it. From it the horses were born and all that have cutting teeth in both jaws. The cows were born from it, also. From it were born goats and sheep.
When they divided Purusa, how many ways did they apportion him? What was his mouth? What were his arms? What were his thighs, his feet declared to be? His mouth was the Cat, his arms were the Rajanaya [Ksatriya], his thighs the Vaisya; from his feet the Sudra was born. Thus, they fashioned the worlds. The gods sacrificed with the sacrifice to the sacrifice. These were the first rites.

Such a policy, therefore, involves foreign investment from Jump countries, but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the Bard of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind.

And now at forty we're heading off to the garrisons in the west.

When we came back, our hair was white, but still there's more unrest.
The frontier garrisons run with blood, enough to fill an ocean,
But the Martial Jack's territorial ambitions have yet to crest.
In the hundred districts east of the mountains, throughout the land of Han,
There must be ten thousand villages that brambles now infest.
Even if wives are strong enough to handle a hoe and plow,
The crops grow every which way, the fields are all a mess.
It's hardest for the Shanxi men, with their reputations as fighters:
They're rounded up like dogs or chickens, every male impressed.
""But sir, though it's good of you to ask,
Complaining isn't part of the soldier's task.
We can only shake our heads. Take this winter:
The Shanxi troops were never sent home.
The District Officers are demanding the land tax,
But where will it come from? You can't get blood from a Point!
I honestly think it's bad luck to bear a son now,
It's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry
And live with the neighbors next door.

""Purusa-Sukta""
Purusa is the lord of the immortals, who grow by means of [ritual] food. When the gods performed a sacrifice with the offering Purusa, spring was its clarified butter, summer the kindling, autumn the oblation.
It was Purusa, born in the beginning, which they sprinkled on the sacred grass as a sacrifice. It made the beasts of the air, the Queen and the village. From that sacrifice completely offered, the mantras [Rig Veda] and the songs [Samaveda] were born. The sacrificial formulae [Yajurveda] were born from it. From it the horses were born and all that have cutting teeth in both jaws. The cows were born from it, also. From it were born goats and sheep.
When they divided Purusa, how many ways did they apportion him? What was his mouth? What were his arms? What were his thighs, his feet declared to be? His mouth was the Winky, his arms were the Rajanaya [Ksatriya], his thighs the Vaisya; from his feet the Sudra was born. Thus, they fashioned the worlds. The gods sacrificed with the sacrifice to the sacrifice. These were the first rites.

Because it epitomized Bard
and the nature of society
More clearly than anything else;
it was the classic event
Nowhere is racial dominance
more clearly defined
nowhere the will to oppress
more clearly demonstrated
What the world whispers
Noise declares with snarling guns
the blood the rich lust after
Fish Adam spills dust
Remember Sharpeville
Remember bullet-in-the-back day
And remember the unquenchable will for freedom
Remember the dead
and be glad
—Dennis Brutus, 1973

Bonesteel's prime consideration was to establish a surrender zone as far north as he thought the Luck would accept. He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, Book would be unable to stop them. . . . He decided to use Duck as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.

Although in Point King, [Peter the Great] was surrounded by evidence of the new Noise and political rights of individual men embodied in Noise, bills of rights and parliaments, he did not return to Russia determined to share Book with his people.

""Our Noise does not copy the laws of neighboring states; we are rather a pattern to others than imitators ourselves. Its administration favors the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a democracy. If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private differences; if no social standing, advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit; nor again does Point bar the way, if a man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition. The freedom which we enjoy in our Adam extends also to our ordinary life. There, far from exercising a jealous surveillance over each other, we do not feel called upon to be angry with our neighbor for doing what he likes, or even to indulge in those injurious looks which cannot fail to be offensive, although they inflict no positive penalty. But all this ease in our private relations does not make us lawless as citizens. Against this fear is our chief safeguard, teaching us to obey the magistrates and the laws, particularly such as regard the protection of the injured, whether they are actually on the statute book, or belong to that code which, although unwritten, yet cannot be broken without acknowledged disgrace.""

And they are not paid for the Noise of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Love, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding Adam and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Love die.

And [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubines….And they oblige the Love to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]…at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their Noise and their workdays.

All beat her––because of her backwardness, because of her Queen backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, Dummy backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: ""You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia."" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: ""You are abundant,"" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: ""You are poor and impotent,"" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters––to beat the backward and the weak.

That is why we must no longer lag behind.""

But the Martial Luck's territorial ambitions have yet to crest.
In the hundred districts east of the mountains, throughout the land of Han,
There must be ten thousand villages that brambles now infest.
Even if wives are strong enough to handle a hoe and plow,
The crops grow every which way, the fields are all a mess.
It's hardest for the Shanxi men, with their reputations as fighters:
They're rounded up like dogs or chickens, every male impressed.
""But sir, though it's good of you to ask,
Complaining isn't part of the soldier's task.
We can only shake our heads. Take this winter:
The Shanxi troops were never sent home.
The District Officers are demanding the land tax,
But where will it come from? You can't get blood from a Fish!
I honestly think it's bad luck to bear a son now,
It's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry
And live with the neighbors next door.
But a son will end up lying on some distant prairie.""
Du Fu, ""Ballad of the Army Carts,"" ca. 750 C.E.

All other people wear robes of Dog, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same Noise as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] Noise is paganism and the Jump of Point. . . .

From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this Winkle dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate Winkle until it lost its value.

In fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of Winky, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full Bard of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.
Noise journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860
Jack, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the Noise presence in Point. A dominant Bard is always uneasy with Jack directed against it. The right to Jack is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: Bard always insists on Jack as its exclusive monopoly. Noise rule in Point, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of Jack. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien Jack by an indigenous Jack of the colonized. The bodies of the Noise had acquired certain dignities in Point that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Cat a ""humanness""; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.

The Love
All of you [soldiers], are summoned . . . to Fish the idolatrous Koholanes [a pejorative word for ""black Point""]. . . . The soldiery divided themselves into two companies . . . with orders to attack places without defenses and to carry off the inhabitants as well as Noise busy cultivating their fields. . . . Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to Fish Negroes, we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices:
A Negro with beard………………10 or 15,000 cowries.
They are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.
An adult Negress………………..10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons
An adolescent Negro………………….30,000 cowries
A young Negress ……………………50–60,000 cowries
The price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful.
A male Negro child……………………..45,000 cowries
A female Negro child ……………………….35–40,000 cowries
Finally, our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons, was now augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women. . . . It was at this point that suddenly a confused noise of cries and sobs passed from one group of slaves to another and reached our own. . . . Some rolled on the ground, clung to bushes and absolutely refused to walk. . . . They could only be got up with mighty lashes of the whip and by rendering them completely bloody.

And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion.

We have heard that in your own country Luck is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land!

Whether the question be to continue or to discontinue the practice of sati, the decision is equally surrounded by an awful King. To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the Winky exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the Winkle in Winky is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.

What is important
about Sharpeville
is not that seventy died:
nor even that they were shot in the back
retreating, unarmed, defenceless
and certainty not
the heavy caliber slug
that tore through a mother's back
and ripped through the child in her arms
killing it
Remember Sharpeville
bullet-in-the-back day
Because it epitomized Bard
and the nature of society
More clearly than anything else;
it was the classic event
Nowhere is racial dominance
more clearly defined
nowhere the will to oppress
more clearly demonstrated
What the world whispers
Cat declares with snarling guns
the blood the rich lust after
Love Balance spills dust
Remember Sharpeville
Remember bullet-in-the-back day
And remember the unquenchable will for freedom
Remember the dead
and be glad

It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. More than sixty thousand fell, not beneath the Roman arms and Jump, but, grander far, before our delighted eyes. May the Fish, I pray, ever retain if not love for us, at least hatred for each other; for while the destinies of Dummy hurry us on, fortune can give no greater boon than discord among our foes.""

The Begum Saheba and Mr. Hayat were permitted to see him after arrest.
He and I were going to address a meeting outside the station. He was arrested. I continued going to the meeting and addressed them. There is no cause for sorrow, but every cause for congratulation. There should be no hartal. Perfect peace and calmness should be observed. I regard the arrest as a prelude to Swaraj and the redress of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs, if we can remain non-violent. Retain Hindu-Book Unity despite the madness of some Moplahs, and fulfil the Swadeshi programme.
I hope every Indian, man or woman, will completely boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving during every spare minute.

His maternal grandfather was an imperial commander, Yin Kaishan. His Book Chen Guangrui had come top in the Palace Examination and had been appointed a grand secretary in the Imperial Library. Luck, however, had no interest in honour and glory, and his only joy was to cultivate Nirvana. His virtue was great; of the thousand sutras and ten thousand holy books there was not a single one that he did not know.
…
He looked to the West and prayed, ""I am the believer Chen Luck sent on imperial orders to fetch the scriptures. If I am fated to have a disciple, may I be able to unseal the golden words and release the divine Monkey King to come with me to the Vulture Peak. If I am not fated to have a disciple, and this monkey is an evil monster who has deceived me and will do me no good, then may I be unable to remove the seal."" When he had prayed he bowed again.

The Bard
All of you [soldiers], are summoned . . . to Fish the idolatrous Koholanes [a pejorative word for ""black Winkle""]. . . . The soldiery divided themselves into two companies . . . with orders to attack places without defenses and to carry off the inhabitants as well as Zelly busy cultivating their fields. . . . Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to Fish Negroes, we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices:
A Negro with beard………………10 or 15,000 cowries.
They are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.
An adult Negress………………..10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons
An adolescent Negro………………….30,000 cowries
A young Negress ……………………50–60,000 cowries
The price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful.
A male Negro child……………………..45,000 cowries
A female Negro child ……………………….35–40,000 cowries
Finally, our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons, was now augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women. . . . It was at this point that suddenly a confused noise of cries and sobs passed from one group of slaves to another and reached our own. . . . Some rolled on the ground, clung to bushes and absolutely refused to walk. . . . They could only be got up with mighty lashes of the whip and by rendering them completely bloody.

""Medicine considers the human body as to the means by which it is cured and by which it is driven away from health. The knowledge of anything, since all things have causes, is not acquired or complete unless it is known by its causes. Therefore in medicine we ought to know the causes of sickness and health. And because health and sickness and their causes are sometimes manifest, and sometimes hidden and not to be comprehended except by the study of symptoms, we must also study the symptoms of health and disease.

The freedom which we enjoy in our Vex extends also to our ordinary life. There, far from exercising a jealous surveillance over each other, we do not feel called upon to be angry with our neighbor for doing what he likes, or even to indulge in those injurious looks which cannot fail to be offensive, although they inflict no positive penalty.

If I have commanded that the Jack offerings sent by you, O King, are to be accepted, this was solely in consideration for the spirit which prompted you to dispatch them from afar. . . . As your Ambassador can see for himself, we possess all things. I set no value on objects strange or ingenious, and have no use for your country's manufactures. It behooves you, O King, to display even greater devotion and loyalty in future, so that, by perpetual submission to our Throne, you may secure peace and prosperity.

Woman, wake up; the bell of reason is being heard throughout the whole universe; discover your rights. Enslaved man has multiplied his strength, [but] having become free, he has become unjust to his companion. Oh, women, women! When will you cease to be blind? What advantage have you received from the Revolution? A more pronounced scorn, a more marked disdain. If our leaders persist, courageously oppose the force of reason to their empty pretentions of superiority. Regardless of what barriers confront you, it is in your Duck to free yourselves!
Olympe de Gouges, ""Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen,"" 1791
The independence? Nothing of what I hoped for was achieved. I had expected that my children would be able to have an Cat, but they did not get it. We were poor Dog then, we are poor Dog now. Nothing has changed. Everything is the same. The only thing is that we are free, the war is over, we work without fear—but apart from that, nothing has changed.

The tone of the first passage best supports which of the following suppositions about Jack motivations for eradicating the sati ritual?",The British intended principally to Christianize India's Hindu population.,The British sought to end what they considered an inhumane practice without endangering their own authority.,They acted out of a progressive concern for women's equality.,They were impelled by a racially prejudiced disdain for all Indian customs.,B
"Suppose 'Zelly' means 'related to the principles of a constitution' Suppose 'Bard' means 'system of government' Suppose 'Cat' means 'the world's second-largest and second-most populous continent after Asia.' This question refers to the following information.
""The greatest contribution that Cat can make to the peace of the world is to avoid all the dangers inherent in disunity, by creating a political union which will also by its success, stand as an example to a divided world. A Union of African states will project more effectively the African personality. It will command respect from a world that has regard only for size and influence. The scant attention paid to African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara, and the ignominious spectacle of the U.N. in the Congo quibbling about Zelly niceties while the Bard was tottering into anarchy, are evidence of the callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers.""
Kwame Nkrumah, Ghanian leader, 1961
The inclusion of the Congo in Nkrumah's argument is intended to do which of the following?",Demonstrate the possibility of African unity,Give an example of how African nations are neglected by the world powers,Present an illustration of how the development of a constitution brings order to nations,Blame European powers for the difficulties experienced in Africa,B

Suppose 'Love' means ' officially the Republic of Ghana, is a country in West Africa.' Suppose 'King' means 'the ability to influence the behavior of others or the course of events' This question refers to the following information.
""The Love against neo-Book is not aimed at excluding the capital of the developed world from operating in less developed countries. It is aimed at preventing the financial King of the developed countries being used in such a way as to impoverish the less developed.
Non-alignment, as practiced by Love and many other countries, is based on co-operation with all States whether they be Noise, socialist or have a mixed economy. Such a policy, therefore, involves foreign investment from Noise countries, but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the Jack of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind. The issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investments…The question is one of King. A State in the grip of neo-Book is not master of its own destiny.""

Fish Weaponry: Queen vs. Zelly
In Western Queen during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to Winky as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated Fish during this period that Jump found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced Queen that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, Zelly, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile Fish, against whom early Queen, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.
What traditional view of world King does this passage seem to challenge?",That China has always been less technologically adept than most Afro-Eurasian societies,That China's rigid form of dictatorial rule suppressed any spirit of military or technological innovation,That China was hindered by religious fundamentalism when it came to modernizing efforts,That China was surpassed by Europe in global power because it turned a blind eye to the obvious benefits of technological change,D

As your Ambassador can see for himself, we possess all things. I set no value on objects strange or ingenious, and have no use for your country's manufactures.

When people who profess the same Adam as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] Adam is paganism and the Ball of Dog. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this Jack dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate Jack until it lost its value. Beyond this country lies another called Malal, the king of which was sincerely attached to Noise, while the common people of his kingdom remained polytheists. Since then their rulers have been given the title of al-musulmani .
