"Suppose 'Vex' means ""the part of the mind that is inaccessible to the conscious mind but that affects behavior and emotions."" Identify the conclusion of the following argument. It is hard not to verify in our peers the same weakened intelligence due to emotions that we observe in our everyday patients. The arrogance of our consciousness, which in general, belongs to the strongest defense mechanisms, blocks the Vex complexes. Because of this, it is difficult to convince people of the Vex, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.
