"Suppose 'Speed' means 'A regression model that tests the long-run equilibrium relationship between variables' Suppose 'Book' means 'a statistical test used to determine if there is a long-run relationship between two variables' Suppose 'Cat' means 'The difference between the observed value of the dependent variable and the predicted value by a regression model' If the Book is applied to the Cat of a potentially Speed, what would be the interpretation of the null hypothesis?","The variables are cointegrated","The variables are not cointegrated","Both variables are stationary","Both variables are non-stationary","B"
"Suppose 'Jump' means 'The correlation of a time series with a lagged version of itself.' Suppose 'Book' means 'Partial Autocorrelation Function, a function that represents the correlation between elements of a time series at different lags, after removing the effects of shorter lags' Suppose 'Ball' means 'Autocorrelation Function, a function that represents the correlation between elements of a time series at different lags' Which of the following statements are true concerning the Jump function (Ball) and partial Jump function (Book)?

i) The Ball and Book will always be identical at lag one whatever the model

ii) The Book for an MA(q) model will in general be non-zero beyond lag q

iii) The Book for an AR(p) model will be zero beyond lag p

iv) The Ball and Book will be the same at lag two for an MA(1) model","(ii) and (iv) only","(i) and (iii) only","(i), (ii), and (iii) only","(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)","C"
