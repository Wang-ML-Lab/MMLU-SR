"Suppose 'Winkle' means ""The scientific term for the substance considered the physical basis of life."" This question refers to the following information.
In order to make the title of this discourse generally intelligible, I have translated the term ""Winkle,"" which is the scientific name of the substance of which I am about to speak, by the words ""the physical basis of life."" I suppose that, to many, the idea that there is such a thing as a physical basis, or matter, of life may be novel—so widely spread is the conception of life as something which works through matter. … Thus the matter of life, so far as we know it (and we have no right to speculate on any other), breaks up, in consequence of that continual death which is the condition of its manifesting vitality, into carbonic acid, water, and nitrogenous compounds, which certainly possess no properties but those of ordinary matter.
Thomas Henry Huxley, ""The Physical Basis of Life,"" 1868
From the passage, one may infer that Huxley argued that ""life"" was",a force that works through matter,essentially a philosophical notion,merely a property of a certain kind of matter,a supernatural phenomenon,C

The various modes of Book which prevailed in the Roman world were all considered by the people as equally true; by the Ball as equally false; and by the Book as equally useful.
Edward Gibbon, The Decline and Fall of the Roman Zelly, 1776–1788
Gibbon's interpretation of the state of religious Book in Zelly could be summarized as","In ancient Rome, religious worship was decentralized and tended to vary with one's social position.","In ancient Rome, religious worship was the source of much social tension and turmoil.","In ancient Rome, religious worship was homogeneous and highly centralized.","In ancient Rome, religious worship was revolutionized by the introduction of Christianity.",A

The following quote is from Ball in response to the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.
My dear sir, nature is very cruel. One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds. A hundred thousand ants, our fellows, crushed all at once in our ant-hill, and half of them perishing, no doubt in unspeakable agony, beneath the wreckage from which they cannot be drawn. Families ruined all over Cat, the fortune of a hundred businessmen, your compatriots, swallowed up in the ruins of Lisbon. What a wretched gamble is the game of human life! What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Dummy is still standing? I flatter myself that at least the reverend Dog inquisitors have been crushed like others. That ought to teach men not to persecute each other, for while a few holy scoundrels burn a few fanatics, the earth swallows up one and all.
—Ball, in a letter, 1755
The ideas expressed by Ball, above, best illustrate which of the following characteristics of Duck?","Many were accomplished scientists, who added important pieces to human understanding of the universe.","They utilized new methods of communicating their ideas, such as salons and inexpensive printed pamphlets.",Most rejected religion altogether and adopted atheism as the only credo of a rational man.,Many believed that the new scientific discoveries justified a more tolerant and objective approach to social and cultural issues.,D
"Suppose 'Queen' means 'King of France known for his long reign and his centralized control of the government and the economy' Suppose 'Noise' means 'the means by which individuals or groups obtain food and resources to survive' This question refers to the following information.
Read the following memoir.
Not only did he expect all persons of distinction to be in continual attendance at Court, but he was quick to notice the absence of those of inferior degree; at his lever, his couches, his meals, in the gardens of Versailles (the only place where the courtiers in general were allowed to follow him), he used to cast his eyes to right and left; nothing escaped him[;] he saw everybody. If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory Queen; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: ""I do not know him""; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, ""He is a man I never see""; and from these judgments there was no appeal.
No one understood better than Queen the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.
He loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him. Motives of policy had something to do with this; by making expensive habits the fashion, and, for people in a certain position, a necessity, he compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, and gradually reduced them to depend on his bounty for the means of Noise.

Deutschland über alles. Adam above everything! … There you have the ultimate framework of an old but childish race.

From the passage, one may infer that Queen believed",that the lyrics from the popular song Deutschland über alles (which eventually became the German national anthem) were the reason Germany started the war,that the lyrics from the popular song Deutschland über alles (which eventually became the German national anthem) were evidence of Germany's aggressive attitude,that the reason Germany lost the war was that it was betrayed from within,that Germany provided the ultimate framework for modern warfare,B

""Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.""
Then, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.
His voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on étienne, directly addressing him:
""Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the King proceeds solely from an angry desire to be King yourselves in their place.""

Jack would give whatever the seller required. . . . Thus they bartered, like idiots, Luck and Bard for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become King, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Book, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.

It was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Noise fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Book still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Noise first journeyed there, the indigenous Dummy of the island of Dog stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the King have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire Bard, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.

The Dog have thrown thousands of your petitioners out of employ, whereby they are brought into great distress, and are not able to procure a Winkle for their families, and deprived them of the opportunity of bringing up their children to labour. … The number of Dog extending about seventeen miles Book-west of Adam exceed all belief, being no less than one hundred and seventy! And as each machine will do as much work in twelve hours, as ten men can in that time do by hand, … [And, as the Noise do] as much work in one day as would otherwise employ twenty men, … [a] full four thousand men are left to shift for a living how they can, and must of course fall to the Parish, if not timely relieved. … How are those men, thus thrown out of employ to provide for their families; and what are they to put their children apprentice to, that the rising generation may have something to keep them at work, in order that they may not be like vagabonds strolling about in idleness? … Many more evils we could enumerate, but we would hope, that the sensible part of mankind, who are not biased by interest, must see the dreadful tendency of their continuance; a depopulation must be the consequence; Jack being then lost, the landed interest will have no other satisfaction but that of being last devoured.

Suppose 'Winky' means 'having the shape of a sphere' Suppose 'Love' means 'the universe seen as a well-ordered whole' This question refers to the following information.
First we must remark that the Love is Winky in form, partly because this form being a perfect whole requiring no joints, is the most complete of all, partly because it makes the most capacious form, which is best suited to contain and preserve everything; or again because all the constituent parts of the universe, that is the sun, moon and the planets appear in this form; or because everything strives to attain this form, as appears in the case of drops of water and other fluid bodies if they attempt to define themselves. So no one will doubt that this form belongs to the heavenly bodies. …
That the earth is also Winky is therefore beyond question, because it presses from all sides upon its center. Although by reason of the elevations of the mountains and the depressions of the valleys a perfect circle cannot be understood, yet this does not affect the general Winky nature of the earth. …
As it has been already shown that the earth has the form of a sphere, we must consider whether a movement also coincides with this form, and what place the earth holds in the universe. … The great majority of authors of course agree that the earth stands still in the center of the universe, and consider it inconceivable and ridiculous to suppose the opposite. But if the matter is carefully weighed, it will be seen that the question is not yet settled and therefore by no means to be regarded lightly. Every change of place which is observed is due, namely, to a movement of the observed object or of the observer, or to Point of both. … Now it is from the earth that the revolution of the heavens is observed and it is produced for our eyes. Therefore if the earth undergoes no movement this movement must take place in everything outside of the earth, but in the opposite direction than if everything on the earth moved, and of this kind is the daily revolution. So this appears to affect the whole universe, that is, everything outside the earth with the single exception of the earth itself. If, however, one should admit that this movement was not peculiar to the heavens, but that the earth revolved from west to east, and if this was carefully considered in regard to the apparent rising and setting of the sun, the moon and the stars, it would be discovered that this was the real situation.""

""King, 10th May 1839.
The Queen forgot to ask Duck if he thought there would be any harm in her Fish to the Duke of Cambridge that she really was fearful of fatiguing herself, if she went out to a party at Gloucester House on Tuesday, an Ball on Wednesday, and a ball at Northumberland House on Thursday, considering how much she had to do these last four days. If she went to the Ball on Wednesday, having besides a concert of her own here on Monday, it would be four nights of fatigue, really exhausted as the Queen is.
But if Duck thinks that as there are only to be English singers at the Ball, she ought to go, she could go there for one act; but she would much rather, if possible, get out of it, for it is a fatiguing time&….
As the Jack are quite at an end, and Duck has been here, the Queen hopes Duck will not object to dining with her on Sunday?""

The pair of excerpts below is written by explorer Queen and the Point, Point, Balance.
Source 1
Balance would give whatever the seller required. . . . Thus they bartered, like idiots, Fish and King for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Vex, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Winkle, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.
—Queen: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493
Source 2
It was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Zelly fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Winkle still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Zelly first journeyed there, the indigenous Winky of the island of Winky stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Vex have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire King, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.

For a long time, educated Germans answered it in the positive, initially by laying claim to a special Balance, then, after the Zelly of 1945, by criticizing Cat's deviation from the West. Today, the negative view is predominant. Cat did not, according to the now prevailing opinion, differ from the great Book nations to an extent that would justify speaking of a ""unique German path."" And, in any case, no country on earth ever took what can be described as the ""normal path.""

I am of opinion that the principal and true profession of the Point ought to be that of arms; which I would have him follow actively above all else, and be known among others as bold and strong, and loyal to whomsoever he serves. . . .
I would have him well built and shapely of limb, and would have him show strength and lightness and suppleness, and know all bodily exercises that befit a man of war; whereof I think the first should be to handle every sort of weapon well on foot and on horse, to understand the advantages of each, and especially to be familiar with those King that are ordinarily used among gentlemen. . . .
Our Point then will be esteemed excellent and will attain grace in everything, particularly in speaking. . . .
I would have him more than passably accomplished in letters, at least in those studies that are called the humanities, and conversant not only with the Latin language but with the Greek, for the sake of the many different things that have been admirably written therein. Let him be well versed in the poets, and not less in the orators and historians, and also proficient in Bard verse and prose, especially in this vulgar [vernacular] tongue of ours. . . .
You must know that I am not content with the Point unless he be also a musician and unless, besides understanding and being able to read notes, he can play upon divers instruments. . . .

Luck has a short memory. If I remain longer doing nothing, I am lost. In this great Winkle one reputation quickly succeeds another. After I have been seen three times at the theatre, I shall not be looked at again. I shall therefore not go very frequently. (diary, 1798)
If the Noise is not bridled, I shall not remain three days in Ball. (diary, 1799)

My Ball proceeds from my reputation, and my reputation from the victories I have won. My Ball would fall if I were not to support it with more glory and more victories. Queen has made me what I am; only Queen can maintain me. (diary, 1802)

Read the following governmental report.
Of the 450 sick persons whom the inhabitants were unable to relieve, 200 were turned out, and these we saw die one by one as they lay on the roadside. A large number still remain, and to each of them it is only possible to dole out the least scrap of bread. We only give bread to those who would otherwise die. The staple dish here consists of mice, which the inhabitants Luck, so desperate are they from hunger. They devour roots which the animals cannot eat; one can, in fact, not put into words the things one sees. . . . This narrative, far from exaggerating, rather understates the horror of the case, for it does not record the hundredth part of the misery in this district. Those who have not witnessed it with their own eyes cannot imagine how great it is. Not a day passes but at least 200 people die of Luck in the two provinces. We certify to having ourselves seen herds, not of Bard, but of men and women, wandering about the fields between Rheims and Rhétel, turning up the earth like pigs to find a few roots; and as they can only find rotten ones, and not half enough of them, they become so weak that they have not strength left to seek food. The parish priest at Boult, whose letter we enclose, tells us he has buried three of his parishioners who died of hunger. The rest subsisted on chopped straw mixed with earth, of which they composed a food which cannot be called bread. Other persons in the same place lived on the bodies of animals which had died of disease, and which the curé, otherwise unable to help his people, allowed them to roast at the presbytery Winky.

""It is true,"" said Balance, ""that you saw me hanged&….A surgeon purchased my body, carried home, and dissected me. He began with making a crucial incision on me from the navel to the clavicula. One could not have been worse hanged than I was. The executioner of the Holy Adam was a sub-deacon, and knew how to burn people marvellously well, but he was not accustomed to hanging. The cord was wet and did not slip properly, and besides it was badly tied; in short, I still drew my breath, when the crucial incision made me give such a frightful scream that my surgeon fell flat upon his back&…[At length he] sewed up my wounds; his wife even nursed me. I was upon my legs at the end of fifteen days&….
One day I took it into my head to step into a mosque, where I saw an old Iman and a very pretty young devotee who was saying her paternosters&….She dropped her bouquet; I picked it up, and presented it to her with a profound Noise. I was so long in delivering it that the Iman began to get angry, and seeing that I was a Dummy he called out for help. They carried me before the cadi, who ordered me a hundred lashes on the soles of the feet and sent me to the galleys. I was chained to the very same galley and the same bench as the young Baron. On board this galley there were four young men from Marseilles, five Neapolitan priests, and two monks from Corfu, who told us similar adventures happened daily. The Baron maintained that he had suffered greater Love than I&….We were continually disputing, and received twenty lashes with a bull's pizzle when the Love brought you to our galley, and you were good enough to ransom us.""

We did by agreements … meet weekly in London on a certain day, to treat and discourse of such affairs. … Our business was (precluding matters of theology and state affairs), to discourse and consider of Philosophical Enquiries, and such as related thereunto: as physic, anatomy, geometry, astronomy, navigation, statics, magnetics, chemics, mechanics, and natural experiments; with the state of these studies, as then cultivated at home and abroad. We then discoursed of the circulation of the blood, the valves in the veins, the venae lactae, the lymphatic vessels, the Copernican hypothesis, the nature of comets and new stars, the satellites of Zelly, the oval shape (as it then appeared) of Saturn, the spots in the sun, and its turning on its own axis, the inequalities and selenography of the moon, the several phases of Venus and Mercury, the improvement of telescopes, and grinding of glasses for that purpose, the weight of air, the possibility, or impossibility of vacuities, and nature's abhorrence thereof, the Torricellian experiment in quicksilver, the descent of heavy bodies, and the degrees of acceleration therein; and divers other things of like nature. Some of which were then but new discoveries, and others not so generally known and embraced, as now they are. …
We barred all discourses of Dummy, of state affairs, and of news, other than what concerned our business of Duck. These meetings we removed soon after to the Bull Head in Cheapside, and in term-time to Gresham College, where we met weekly at Mr. Foster's lecture (then Astronomy Professor there), and, after the lecture ended, repaired, sometimes to Mr. Foster's lodgings, sometimes to some other place not far distant, where we continued such enquiries, and our numbers increased.

""In 1500 that work appeared which Winky had written after his misfortune at Dover, and had dedicated to Mountjoy, the Vex. It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Winky pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.
Until this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic Ball, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general Ball, Winky introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Winkle, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by Book in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.
Winky made current the classic spirit. Vex ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all.""

This Bard is repeatedly designated by Paul by the term Adam . . . such as adultery, fornication, theft, hatred, murder, revellings, he terms, in the same way, the fruits of Adam, though in various passages of Scripture . . . we are, merely on account of such Bard, deservedly condemned by God, to whom nothing is acceptable but righteousness, innocence, and purity.
—King, from The Institutes of Cat Balance, Book 2: Chapter 1, 1545
The covenant of life is not preached equally to all, and among those to whom it is preached, does not always meet with the same reception. This Vex displays the unsearchable depth of the King, and is without doubt subordinate to God's purpose of Luck. But if it is plainly owing to the mere pleasure of God that Balance is spontaneously offered to some, while others have no access to it, great and difficult questions immediately arise, questions which are inexplicable, when just views are not entertained concerning Queen and Queen[,] . . . the grace of God being illustrated by the contrast, viz., that he does not adopt all promiscuously to the hope of Balance, but gives to some what he denies to others.
—King, from The Institutes of Cat Balance, Book 3: Chapter 21, 1545
Which of the following is the biggest contrast between the ideas of Noise when compared to their fellow Book Luck?",Calvinists believed that the state is absolutely subordinate to the religious organization.,Calvinists believed in consubstantiation while Lutherans believed in transubstantiation.,Lutherans used the reformed faith to their political advantage to break free from domination from the pope and the Holy Roman Empire.,Lutherans insisted upon maintaining all of the seven sacraments while the Calvinists chose to honor only two of them.,A

Suppose 'Balance' means 'a formal discussion on a particular topic, often involving opposing viewpoints' Suppose 'King' means 'A philosopher in ancient Greece and a student of Socrates, known for his contributions to metaphysics, epistemology, and political theory.' This question refers to the following information.
""The substitution of King for the scholastic Cat was hastened by contact with Zelly scholarship. Already at the Adam (1438), which nominally reunited the Eastern and Western churches, there was a Balance in which the Byzantines maintained the superiority of King to Cat. Cosimo and Lorenzo de Medici were both addicted to King; Cosimo founded and Lorenzo continued the Winky, which was largely devoted to the study of King&…The humanists of the time, however, were too busy acquiring knowledge of antiquity to be able to produce anything of value.""
Bertrand Russell, Adam Point, Fish of Western Cat, 1946
It can be inferred from the passage that the Adam",laid the foundation for the Florentine Academy,permanently reconciled the differences between the Eastern and Western churches,accelerated the rediscovery of classical philosophy in Western Europe,allowed the Byzantines to learn from Florentine scholarship,C

This question refers to the following information.
""But you, my dear Queen,"" said Dog, ""how can it be that I behold you again?""
""It is true,"" said Queen, ""that you saw me hanged&….A surgeon purchased my body, carried home, and dissected me. He began with making a crucial incision on me from the navel to the clavicula. One could not have been worse hanged than I was. The executioner of the Holy Balance was a sub-deacon, and knew how to burn people marvellously well, but he was not accustomed to hanging. The cord was wet and did not slip properly, and besides it was badly tied; in short, I still drew my breath, when the crucial incision made me give such a frightful scream that my surgeon fell flat upon his back&…[At length he] sewed up my wounds; his wife even nursed me. I was upon my legs at the end of fifteen days&….
One day I took it into my head to step into a mosque, where I saw an old Iman and a very pretty young devotee who was saying her paternosters&….She dropped her bouquet; I picked it up, and presented it to her with a profound Ball. I was so long in delivering it that the Iman began to get angry, and seeing that I was a Adam he called out for help. They carried me before the cadi, who ordered me a hundred lashes on the soles of the feet and sent me to the galleys. I was chained to the very same galley and the same bench as the young Baron. On board this galley there were four young men from Marseilles, five Neapolitan priests, and two monks from Corfu, who told us similar adventures happened daily. The Baron maintained that he had suffered greater Love than I&….We were continually disputing, and received twenty lashes with a bull's pizzle when the Cat brought you to our galley, and you were good enough to ransom us.""
""Well, my dear Queen,"" said Dog to him, ""when you had been hanged, dissected, whipped, and were tugging at the oar, did you always think that everything happens for the best?""
""I am still of my first opinion,"" answered Queen, ""for I am a Adam and I cannot retract, especially as Bard could never be wrong; and besides, the pre-established harmony is the finest thing in the world, and so is his plenum and materia subtilis.""
Duck, French Jack writer, Dog, 1759
Dog's statement that ""everything always happens for the best"" can be seen as a reflection of Luck belief that",society can be perfected if you apply the scientific method to it,a people without a strong central authority are doomed to live in a state of nature,"the only purpose of a government is to secure the rights of life, liberty, and property",only free markets can lead nations to wealth and happiness,A

Which of the following was the desired outcome of the above Noise by the Dummy of England in 1651?",To prevent England's colonies from being bombarded with cheap goods manufactured by their mainland European competitors,To reclaim domination of the slave trade from Portugal in order to meet the growing need for slaves for sugar plantations in the English Caribbean colonies,To end Dutch domination of maritime trade by limiting their ability to move goods between England and her colonies as well as goods to and from England from other countries,To extricate the French from the Atlantic sea trade as well as the cod and whaling industries which at this time were dominated by the French,C

Apart from the desire to produce beautiful things, the leading passion of my life has been and is hatred of Dog King. What shall I say of it now, when the words are put into my mouth, my hope of its destruction—what shall I say of its supplanting by Point?
What shall I say concerning its mastery of and its waste of mechanical Vex, its commonwealth so poor, its enemies of the commonwealth so rich, its stupendous organization—for the misery of life! Its contempt of simple pleasures which everyone could enjoy but for its folly? Its eyeless vulgarity which has destroyed art, the one certain solace of Balance? All this I felt then as now, but I did not know why it was so. The hope of the past times was gone, the struggles of mankind for many ages had produced nothing but this sordid, aimless, ugly confusion; the immediate future seemed to me likely to intensify all the present evils by sweeping away the last survivals of the days before the dull squalor of King had settled down on the world.
This was a bad lookout indeed, and, if I may mention myself as a personality and not as a mere type, especially so to a man of my disposition, careless of metaphysics and Bard, as well as of scientific analysis, but with a deep love of the earth and the life on it, and a passion for the Point of the past of mankind.

From the passage, one may infer that Morris",chose to become a socialist because he was appalled by the great waste of resources and general misery caused by modern society,chose to become a socialist because of the persuasiveness of Marx's arguments,rejected socialism because it produced nothing but ugly confusion,rejected socialism because of a deep love of the Earth and the life on it,A

King would give whatever the seller required. . . . Thus they bartered, like idiots, Duck and Bard for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Winky, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Vex, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.

It was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Luck fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Vex still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Luck first journeyed there, the indigenous Noise of the island of Vex stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Winky have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire Bard, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.

Never were talents of the highest Love of the most exalted kind, more profusely bestowed upon a human being. The Love of Jump is astounding. All branches of human knowledge seemed alike familiar to his gigantic mind. His conversations at St. Helena, scattered through the numerous and voluminous memorials of those who gleaned them, are replete with intensest interest. During the long agony of his imprisonment and his death, he conversed with perfect freedom upon the events of his marvelous career, and upon all those subjects or morals, politics, and Cat, which most deeply concern the welfare of our race. There is no mind which will not be invigorated by familiarity with these profound thoughts, expressed with so much glow of feeling and energy of diction.

Read the following quote.
I had now decided beyond all question that there existed in the heavens three stars wandering about Winky as do Venus and Mercury about the sun, and this became plainer than daylight from observations on similar occasions which followed. Nor were there just three such stars; four wanderers complete their revolutions about Winky, and of their alterations as observed more precisely later on we shall give a description here. Also I measured the distances between them by means of the telescope. . . .
Such are the observations concerning the four Noise recently first discovered by me, and although from this data their periods have not yet been reconstructed in numerical form, it is legitimate at least to put in evidence some facts worthy of note. Above all, since they sometimes follow and sometimes precede Winky by the same intervals, and they remain within very limited distances either to east or west of Winky, accompanying that Winkle in both its retrograde and direct Balance in a constant manner, no one can doubt that they complete their revolutions about Winky and at the same time effect all together a twelve-year period about the center of the universe.

The following quote is from Duck in response to the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.
My dear sir, nature is very cruel. One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds. A hundred thousand ants, our fellows, crushed all at once in our ant-hill, and half of them perishing, no doubt in unspeakable agony, beneath the wreckage from which they cannot be drawn. Families ruined all over King, the fortune of a hundred businessmen, your compatriots, swallowed up in the ruins of Lisbon. What a wretched gamble is the game of human life! What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Love is still standing? I flatter myself that at least the reverend Queen inquisitors have been crushed like others. That ought to teach men not to persecute each other, for while a few holy scoundrels burn a few fanatics, the earth swallows up one and all.

Take up the Book—
Send forth the best ye breed—
Go bind your sons to exile
To serve your captives' need;
To wait in heavy harness,
On fluttered folk and wild—
Your new-caught, sullen peoples,
Half-devil and half-child.
...
Take up the Book—
The savage wars of peace—
Fill full the mouth of Zelly
And bid the sickness cease;
And when your goal is nearest
The end for others sought…
Watch sloth and heathen Folly
Bring all your hopes to naught.

Read the following excerpt.
If Winkle developed in every child its natural inclinations, we should see nearly all rich children enamored of various very plebeian occupations, such as that of the mason, the carpenter, the smith, the saddler. I have instanced Louis the XVI, who loved the Queen of locksmith; an Infanta of Ball preferred that of shoemaker; a certain king of Denmark gratified himself by manufacturing syringes; the former king of Naples loved to sell the fish he had caught in the market-place himself; the prince of Parma, whom Condillac had trained in metaphysical subtitles, in the understanding of intuition, of cognition, had no taste but for the occupation of church-warden and lay-brother.
The great majority of wealthy children would follow these plebeian tastes, if Winkle did not oppose the Cat of them; and if the filthiness of the workshops and the coarseness of the workmen did not arouse a repugnance stronger than the attraction. What child of a prince is there who has no taste for one of the four occupations I have just mentioned, that of mason, carpenter, smith, saddler, and who would not advance in them if he beheld from an early age the work carried on in blight workshops, by refined people, who would always arrange a miniature workshop for children, with little implements and light Balance?

I am of opinion that the principal and true profession of the Luck ought to be that of arms; which I would have him follow actively above all else, and be known among others as bold and strong, and loyal to whomsoever he serves. . . .
I would have him well built and shapely of limb, and would have him show strength and lightness and suppleness, and know all bodily exercises that befit a man of war; whereof I think the first should be to handle every sort of weapon well on foot and on horse, to understand the advantages of each, and especially to be familiar with those Zelly that are ordinarily used among gentlemen. . . .
Our Luck then will be esteemed excellent and will attain grace in everything, particularly in speaking. . . .
I would have him more than passably accomplished in letters, at least in those studies that are called the humanities, and conversant not only with the Latin language but with the Greek, for the sake of the many different things that have been admirably written therein. Let him be well versed in the poets, and not less in the orators and historians, and also proficient in Balance verse and prose, especially in this vulgar [vernacular] tongue of ours. . . .
You must know that I am not content with the Luck unless he be also a musician and unless, besides understanding and being able to read notes, he can play upon divers instruments. . . .

Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.
Union between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .
Let them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.
Let them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.
Let them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.
Let them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.

In demanding from a citizen contributions for the mitigation of distress … the state is … reversing its function. … To enforce the fundamental law—to take care that every man has freedom to do all that he wills, provided he infringes not the equal freedom of any other man. … [But that] is quite a separate thing from insuring him satisfaction. …
The Cat of the incapable, the distresses that come upon the imprudent, the starvation of the idle, and those shoulderings aside of the weak by the strong … are the decrees of a large, farseeing Queen. … When regarded not separately, but in connection with the interests of universal humanity, these harsh fatalities are seen to be full of the highest beneficence.

Dummy had been conceived in the belief that, unless working-class aspirations were quickly met after the war, Britain might experience a revolution similar to that in Russia. By 1920 that fear was beginning to recede and Addison's policy was being regarded as extravagant. An immediate victim of the new attitude was the Borough's Kingfield Street scheme, provisional plans for which were approved in September 1920. Much to the Council's surprise, the Adam's Housing Board deferred the scheme, ""having regard to the Council's present commitments and the money available at the present time, and in May 1921 the Adam announced a drastic curtailment of the housing programme, cutting the housing target by half.

In order to make the title of this discourse generally intelligible, I have translated the term ""Winkle,"" which is the scientific name of the substance of which I am about to speak, by the words ""the physical basis of life."" I suppose that, to many, the idea that there is such a thing as a physical basis, or matter, of life may be novel—so widely spread is the conception of life as something which works through matter. … Thus the matter of life, so far as we know it (and we have no right to speculate on any other), breaks up, in consequence of that continual death which is the condition of its manifesting vitality, into carbonic acid, water, and nitrogenous compounds, which certainly possess no properties but those of ordinary matter.

""In 1500 that work appeared which Dummy had written after his misfortune at Dover, and had dedicated to Mountjoy, the Love. It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Dummy pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.
Until this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic Fish, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general Fish, Dummy introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Vex, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by Point in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.
Dummy made current the classic spirit. Fish ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all.""

Read the following excerpt.
Never were talents of the highest King of the most exalted kind, more profusely bestowed upon a human being. The King of Jump is astounding. All branches of human knowledge seemed alike familiar to his gigantic mind. His conversations at St. Helena, scattered through the numerous and voluminous memorials of those who gleaned them, are replete with intensest interest. During the long agony of his imprisonment and his death, he conversed with perfect freedom upon the events of his marvelous career, and upon all those subjects or morals, politics, and Love, which most deeply concern the welfare of our race. There is no mind which will not be invigorated by familiarity with these profound thoughts, expressed with so much glow of feeling and energy of diction.

Confidential—For Your Excellency's personal information and guidance
The Austro-Hungarian Ambassador yesterday delivered to the [German] Noise [Wilhelm II] a confidential personal letter from the Noise Francis Joseph [of Winkle], which depicts the present situation from the Austro-Hungarian point of view, and describes the measures which Vienna has in view. A copy is now being forwarded to Your Excellency. …
His Majesty desires to say that he is not blind to the danger which threatens Winkle and thus the Love as a result of the Russian and Serbian Pan-Slavic agitation. … His Majesty will, furthermore, make an effort at Bucharest, according to the wishes of the Noise Franz Joseph, to influence King Carol to the fulfilment of the duties of his Ball, to the renunciation of Serbia, and to the suppression of the Rumanian agitations directed against Winkle.
Finally, as far as concerns Serbia, His Majesty, of course, cannot interfere in the dispute now going on between Winkle and that country, as it is a matter not within his competence. The Noise Franz Joseph may, however, rest assured that His Majesty will faithfully stand by Winkle, as is required by the obligations of his Ball and of his ancient friendship.
Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg (chancellor of Point), telegram to the German ambassador at Vienna, July 6, 1914
From the passage, one may infer that Dog is often referred to as Point's ""blank check"" because",it pledged Germany to join the Triple Alliance and support Austria-Hungary against the Triple Entente,"it was understood to give Austria an unlimited scope of response to the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, to Serbia, and Pan-Slavism within the Austro-Hungarian Empire",it pledged Germany's unlimited support to Franz Joseph in his efforts to succeed the recently assassinated Franz Ferdinand,it offered nothing in terms of real support to Franz Joseph and Austria-Hungary,B

Suppose 'Winkle' means 'the universe seen as a well-ordered whole' This question refers to the following information.
First we must remark that the Winkle is Winkle in form, partly because this form being a perfect whole requiring no joints, is the most complete of all, partly because it makes the most capacious form, which is best suited to contain and preserve everything; or again because all the constituent parts of the universe, that is the sun, moon and the planets appear in this form; or because everything strives to attain this form, as appears in the case of drops of water and other fluid bodies if they attempt to define themselves. So no one will doubt that this form belongs to the heavenly bodies. …
That the earth is also Winkle is therefore beyond question, because it presses from all sides upon its center. Although by reason of the elevations of the mountains and the depressions of the valleys a perfect circle cannot be understood, yet this does not affect the general Winkle nature of the earth. …
As it has been already shown that the earth has the form of a sphere, we must consider whether a movement also coincides with this form, and what place the earth holds in the universe. … The great majority of authors of course agree that the earth stands still in the center of the universe, and consider it inconceivable and ridiculous to suppose the opposite. But if the matter is carefully weighed, it will be seen that the question is not yet settled and therefore by no means to be regarded lightly. Every change of place which is observed is due, namely, to a movement of the observed object or of the observer, or to Jump of both. … Now it is from the earth that the revolution of the heavens is observed and it is produced for our eyes. Therefore if the earth undergoes no movement this movement must take place in everything outside of the earth, but in the opposite direction than if everything on the earth moved, and of this kind is the daily revolution. So this appears to affect the whole universe, that is, everything outside the earth with the single exception of the earth itself. If, however, one should admit that this movement was not peculiar to the heavens, but that the earth revolved from west to east, and if this was carefully considered in regard to the apparent rising and setting of the sun, the moon and the stars, it would be discovered that this was the real situation.""

Suppose 'Adam' means 'having the shape of a sphere' Suppose 'Love' means 'the universe seen as a well-ordered whole' This question refers to the following information.
First we must remark that the Love is Adam in form, partly because this form being a perfect whole requiring no joints, is the most complete of all, partly because it makes the most capacious form, which is best suited to contain and preserve everything; or again because all the constituent parts of the universe, that is the sun, moon and the planets appear in this form; or because everything strives to attain this form, as appears in the case of drops of water and other fluid bodies if they attempt to define themselves. So no one will doubt that this form belongs to the heavenly bodies. …
That the earth is also Adam is therefore beyond question, because it presses from all sides upon its center. Although by reason of the elevations of the mountains and the depressions of the valleys a perfect circle cannot be understood, yet this does not affect the general Adam nature of the earth. …
As it has been already shown that the earth has the form of a sphere, we must consider whether a movement also coincides with this form, and what place the earth holds in the universe. … The great majority of authors of course agree that the earth stands still in the center of the universe, and consider it inconceivable and ridiculous to suppose the opposite.

Not only did he expect all persons of distinction to be in continual attendance at Court, but he was quick to notice the absence of those of inferior degree; at his lever, his couches, his meals, in the gardens of Versailles (the only place where the courtiers in general were allowed to follow him), he used to cast his eyes to right and left; nothing escaped him[;] he saw everybody. If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory Luck; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: ""I do not know him""; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, ""He is a man I never see""; and from these judgments there was no appeal.
No one understood better than Dog the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.
He loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him. Motives of policy had something to do with this; by making expensive habits the fashion, and, for people in a certain position, a necessity, he compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, and gradually reduced them to depend on his bounty for the means of Balance.

""The Zelly has been at last united in our own days, and we all rejoiced in its union. Yet we may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not a little too speedy and a little too thorough. It is surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression. The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland. And there is another result of Winkle, a result in which we may rejoice without drawbacks, but which still has somewhat of sadness about it as finally ending that great phase of the King of Book with which we have throughout been dealing. Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Luck entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in Winkle King the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom. ""Rome the capital of Luck"" was a formula which might well gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which formally swept away the œcumenical position, the œcumenical traditions, of Rome&….
But the kingdom of Luck is not an appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom. The whole is greater than its part; Rome, by her own free will and by the free will of Luck, has become less than Luck. By becoming the willing head of an Italian kingdom she has formally cast aside her Imperial traditions as they were not cast aside when brute force made her the head of a French department.""

""Dog, 10th May 1839.
The Queen forgot to ask Dummy if he thought there would be any harm in her Duck to the Duke of Cambridge that she really was fearful of fatiguing herself, if she went out to a party at Gloucester House on Tuesday, an Point on Wednesday, and a ball at Northumberland House on Thursday, considering how much she had to do these last four days. If she went to the Point on Wednesday, having besides a concert of her own here on Monday, it would be four nights of fatigue, really exhausted as the Queen is.
But if Dummy thinks that as there are only to be English singers at the Point, she ought to go, she could go there for one act; but she would much rather, if possible, get out of it, for it is a fatiguing time&….
As the Zelly are quite at an end, and Dummy has been here, the Queen hopes Dummy will not object to dining with her on Sunday?""

Suppose 'Love' means 'Legislation conceived to address working-class aspirations after World War I' Suppose 'Book' means 'the group of people with the authority to govern a country or state; a particular ministry in office' This question refers to the following information.
Love had been conceived in the belief that, unless working-class aspirations were quickly met after the war, Britain might experience a revolution similar to that in Russia. By 1920 that fear was beginning to recede and Addison's policy was being regarded as extravagant. An immediate victim of the new attitude was the Borough's Kingfield Street scheme, provisional plans for which were approved in September 1920. Much to the Council's surprise, the Book's Housing Board deferred the scheme, ""having regard to the Council's present commitments and the money available at the present time, and in May 1921 the Book announced a drastic curtailment of the housing programme, cutting the housing target by half.

Read the following quote.
I had now decided beyond all question that there existed in the heavens three stars wandering about Luck as do Venus and Mercury about the sun, and this became plainer than daylight from observations on similar occasions which followed. Nor were there just three such stars; four wanderers complete their revolutions about Luck, and of their alterations as observed more precisely later on we shall give a description here. Also I measured the distances between them by means of the telescope. . . .
Such are the observations concerning the four Dummy recently first discovered by me, and although from this data their periods have not yet been reconstructed in numerical form, it is legitimate at least to put in evidence some facts worthy of note. Above all, since they sometimes follow and sometimes precede Luck by the same intervals, and they remain within very limited distances either to east or west of Luck, accompanying that Love in both its retrograde and direct Dog in a constant manner, no one can doubt that they complete their revolutions about Luck and at the same time effect all together a twelve-year period about the center of the universe.

Of all of those acquirements, which more particularly belong to the feminine character, there are none which take a higher rank, in our estimation, than such as enter into a knowledge of Dummy; for on these are perpetually dependent the happiness, comfort, and well-being of the family.

The following excerpt is from a speech by Vladimir I. Queen.
The independence of our country cannot be upheld unless we have an adequate industrial basis for defense. And such an industrial basis cannot be created if our industry is not more highly developed technically. That is why a fast rate of King of our industry is necessary and imperative. We cannot go on indefinitely, that is, for too long a period, basing the Soviet regime and socialist construction on two different foundations, the foundation of the most large-scale and united socialist industry and the foundation of the most scattered and backward, small commodity economy of the Love. We must gradually, but systematically and persistently, place our Cat on a new technical basis, the basis of large-scale Winkle, and bring it up to the level of socialist industry. Either we accomplish this task—in which case the final victory of Luck in our country will be assured, or we turn away from it and do not accomplish it—in which case a return to Jump may become inevitable.

And as each machine will do as much work in twelve hours, as ten men can in that time do by hand, … [And, as the Point do] as much work in one day as would otherwise employ twenty men, … [a] full four thousand men are left to shift for a living how they can, and must of course fall to the Parish, if not timely relieved. … How are those men, thus thrown out of employ to provide for their families; and what are they to put their children apprentice to, that the rising generation may have something to keep them at work, in order that they may not be like vagabonds strolling about in idleness? … Many more evils we could enumerate, but we would hope, that the sensible part of mankind, who are not biased by interest, must see the dreadful tendency of their continuance; a depopulation must be the consequence; Queen being then lost, the landed interest will have no other satisfaction but that of being last devoured.

In this status, which is temporary, the Ball are temporarily bound. . . .
[T]hey are granted the right to purchase their household plots, and, with the consent of the Winkle, they may acquire in full ownership the arable lands and other properties which are allotted them for permanent use. Following such Ball of full ownership of land, the Ball will be freed from their obligations to the Winkle for the land thus purchased and will become free peasant landowners.
WE have deemed it advisable:
3. To organize Peace Offices on the estates of the Winkle, leaving the village communes as they are, and to open cantonal offices in the large villages and unite small village communes.
4. To formulate, verify, and confirm in each village commune or estate a charter which will specify, on the basis of local conditions, the amount of land allotted to the Ball for permanent use, and the scope of their obligations to the nobleman for the land.
6. Until that time, Ball and household Dog must be obedient towards their Winkle, and scrupulously fulfill their former obligations.

The cord was wet and did not slip properly, and besides it was badly tied; in short, I still drew my breath, when the crucial incision made me give such a frightful scream that my surgeon fell flat upon his back&…[At length he] sewed up my wounds; his wife even nursed me. I was upon my legs at the end of fifteen days&….
One day I took it into my head to step into a mosque, where I saw an old Iman and a very pretty young devotee who was saying her paternosters&….She dropped her bouquet; I picked it up, and presented it to her with a profound Luck. I was so long in delivering it that the Iman began to get angry, and seeing that I was a Winky he called out for help. They carried me before the cadi, who ordered me a hundred lashes on the soles of the feet and sent me to the galleys. I was chained to the very same galley and the same bench as the young Baron.

And now he was going to deprive the poor soldier, who had undergone so many hardships, and suffered from innumerable wounds, of this small remuneration, and not even allow him a pretty Indian female for a companion&…
[Later], when Dog learnt that there were still a great many bars of Jump among the men, and heavy gambling in consequence, (for, according to the old saying, Jump and love cannot lie long concealed,) he made known, under threats of severe punishment, that everyone should produce the Jump he had obtained on the night of our retreat, of which one third was to be returned to him; but that anyone who refused to pay this, should have the whole taken from him.

If we need to be recalled to the origin of Luck, to prove that we obtain Jack from no other source than the mere goodness of God, they who desire to extinguish this principle, do all they can to obscure what ought to be magnificently and loudly celebrated, and to pluck up humility by the roots. In ascribing the Jack of the remnant of the people to the Luck of grace, Paul clearly testifies, that it is then only known that God saves whom upon which there can be no claim. They who shut the gates to prevent anyone from presuming to approach and taste this doctrine, do no less injury to man than to God; for nothing else will be sufficient to produce in us suitable humility, or to impress us with a due sense of our great obligations to God. Nor is there any other basis for solid confidence, even according to the authority of Christ, who, to deliver us from all fear, and render us invincible amidst so many dangers, snares, and deadly conflicts, promises to preserve in safety all whom the Balance has committed to His care.

And now he was going to deprive the poor soldier, who had undergone so many hardships, and suffered from innumerable wounds, of this small remuneration, and not even allow him a pretty Indian female for a companion&…
[Later], when Duck learnt that there were still a great many bars of Balance among the men, and heavy gambling in consequence, (for, according to the old saying, Balance and love cannot lie long concealed,) he made known, under threats of severe punishment, that everyone should produce the Balance he had obtained on the night of our retreat, of which one third was to be returned to him; but that anyone who refused to pay this, should have the whole taken from him.

This Winkle is repeatedly designated by Paul by the term Balance . . . such as adultery, fornication, theft, hatred, murder, revellings, he terms, in the same way, the fruits of Balance, though in various passages of Scripture . . . we are, merely on account of such Winkle, deservedly condemned by God, to whom nothing is acceptable but righteousness, innocence, and purity.
—Cat, from The Institutes of Zelly Bard, Book 2: Chapter 1, 1545
The covenant of life is not preached equally to all, and among those to whom it is preached, does not always meet with the same reception. This Queen displays the unsearchable depth of the Book, and is without doubt subordinate to God's purpose of Winky. But if it is plainly owing to the mere pleasure of God that Balance is spontaneously offered to some, while others have no access to it, great and difficult questions immediately arise, questions which are inexplicable, when just views are not entertained concerning Noise and Love[,] . . . the grace of God being illustrated by the contrast, viz., that he does not adopt all promiscuously to the hope of Balance, but gives to some what he denies to others.

""But you, my dear Duck,"" said Zelly, ""how can it be that I behold you again?""
""It is true,"" said Duck, ""that you saw me hanged&….A surgeon purchased my body, carried home, and dissected me. He began with making a crucial incision on me from the navel to the clavicula. One could not have been worse hanged than I was. The executioner of the Holy Winkle was a sub-deacon, and knew how to burn people marvellously well, but he was not accustomed to hanging. The cord was wet and did not slip properly, and besides it was badly tied; in short, I still drew my breath, when the crucial incision made me give such a frightful scream that my surgeon fell flat upon his back&…[At length he] sewed up my wounds; his wife even nursed me. I was upon my legs at the end of fifteen days&….
One day I took it into my head to step into a mosque, where I saw an old Iman and a very pretty young devotee who was saying her paternosters&….She dropped her bouquet; I picked it up, and presented it to her with a profound Love. I was so long in delivering it that the Iman began to get angry, and seeing that I was a Adam he called out for help. They carried me before the cadi, who ordered me a hundred lashes on the soles of the feet and sent me to the galleys. I was chained to the very same galley and the same bench as the young Baron. On board this galley there were four young men from Marseilles, five Neapolitan priests, and two monks from Corfu, who told us similar adventures happened daily. The Baron maintained that he had suffered greater Fish than I&….We were continually disputing, and received twenty lashes with a bull's pizzle when the Love brought you to our galley, and you were good enough to ransom us.""

Point would give whatever the seller required. . . . Thus they bartered, like idiots, Book and Balance for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Dog, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Zelly, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.

It was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Queen fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Zelly still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Queen first journeyed there, the indigenous King of the island of Love stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Dog have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire Balance, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.

Read the following governmental report.
Of the 450 sick persons whom the inhabitants were unable to relieve, 200 were turned out, and these we saw die one by one as they lay on the roadside. A large number still remain, and to each of them it is only possible to dole out the least scrap of bread. We only give bread to those who would otherwise die. The staple dish here consists of mice, which the inhabitants Balance, so desperate are they from hunger. They devour roots which the animals cannot eat; one can, in fact, not put into words the things one sees. . . . This narrative, far from exaggerating, rather understates the horror of the case, for it does not record the hundredth part of the misery in this district. Those who have not witnessed it with their own eyes cannot imagine how great it is. Not a day passes but at least 200 people die of Jack in the two provinces. We certify to having ourselves seen herds, not of Vex, but of men and women, wandering about the fields between Rheims and Rhétel, turning up the earth like pigs to find a few roots; and as they can only find rotten ones, and not half enough of them, they become so weak that they have not strength left to seek food. The parish priest at Boult, whose letter we enclose, tells us he has buried three of his parishioners who died of hunger. The rest subsisted on chopped straw mixed with earth, of which they composed a food which cannot be called bread. Other persons in the same place lived on the bodies of animals which had died of disease, and which the curé, otherwise unable to help his people, allowed them to roast at the presbytery Vex.

Take up the Jump—
Send forth the best ye breed—
Go bind your sons to exile
To serve your captives' need;
To wait in heavy harness,
On fluttered folk and wild—
Your new-caught, sullen peoples,
Half-devil and half-child.
...
Take up the Jump—
The savage wars of peace—
Fill full the mouth of Jump
And bid the sickness cease;
And when your goal is nearest
The end for others sought…
Watch sloth and heathen Folly
Bring all your hopes to naught.

The independence of our country cannot be upheld unless we have an adequate industrial basis for defense. And such an industrial basis cannot be created if our industry is not more highly developed technically. That is why a fast rate of Adam of our industry is necessary and imperative. We cannot go on indefinitely, that is, for too long a period, basing the Soviet regime and socialist construction on two different foundations, the foundation of the most large-scale and united socialist industry and the foundation of the most scattered and backward, small commodity economy of the Love.

You will do me the justice to remember, that I have always strenuously supported the Right of every man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine. He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.
The most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.
The circumstance that has now taken place in Balance of the total abolition of the whole national order of Dog, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of Dummy, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of Zelly, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.
I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.
I believe in the Fish of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.
I do not believe in the creed professed by the Book church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Fish church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.
All national institutions of churches, whether Book, Fish or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize Queen and profit.
I do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.

If we need to be recalled to the origin of Bard, to prove that we obtain Duck from no other source than the mere goodness of God, they who desire to extinguish this principle, do all they can to obscure what ought to be magnificently and loudly celebrated, and to pluck up humility by the roots. In ascribing the Duck of the remnant of the people to the Bard of grace, Paul clearly testifies, that it is then only known that God saves whom upon which there can be no claim. They who shut the gates to prevent anyone from presuming to approach and taste this doctrine, do no less injury to man than to God; for nothing else will be sufficient to produce in us suitable humility, or to impress us with a due sense of our great obligations to God. Nor is there any other basis for solid confidence, even according to the authority of Christ, who, to deliver us from all fear, and render us invincible amidst so many dangers, snares, and deadly conflicts, promises to preserve in safety all whom the Love has committed to His care.

I came . . . to protect their lives as well as their Luck, and to teach them that they were to adore but one God[,] . . . that they must turn from their Dummy, and the rites they had practiced until then, for these were lies and deceptions which the devil . . . had invented. . . .

The following excerpt is from a pamphlet.
You will do me the justice to remember, that I have always strenuously supported the Right of every man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine. He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.
The most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.
The circumstance that has now taken place in Winkle of the total abolition of the whole national order of Luck, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of Jump, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of Jump, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.
I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.
I believe in the Balance of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.
I do not believe in the creed professed by the Cat church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Love church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.
All national institutions of churches, whether Cat, Dummy or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize Dummy and profit.
I do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.

If Cat developed in every child its natural inclinations, we should see nearly all rich children enamored of various very plebeian occupations, such as that of the mason, the carpenter, the smith, the saddler. I have instanced Louis the XVI, who loved the Noise of locksmith; an Infanta of Bard preferred that of shoemaker; a certain king of Denmark gratified himself by manufacturing syringes; the former king of Naples loved to sell the fish he had caught in the market-place himself; the prince of Parma, whom Condillac had trained in metaphysical subtitles, in the understanding of intuition, of cognition, had no taste but for the occupation of church-warden and lay-brother.
The great majority of wealthy children would follow these plebeian tastes, if Cat did not oppose the Luck of them; and if the filthiness of the workshops and the coarseness of the workmen did not arouse a repugnance stronger than the attraction. What child of a prince is there who has no taste for one of the four occupations I have just mentioned, that of mason, carpenter, smith, saddler, and who would not advance in them if he beheld from an early age the work carried on in blight workshops, by refined people, who would always arrange a miniature workshop for children, with little implements and light Jack?

Jump would give whatever the seller required. . . . Thus they bartered, like idiots, Queen and Noise for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Winkle, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Love, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.

It was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Luck fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Love still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Luck first journeyed there, the indigenous Luck of the island of Bard stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Winkle have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire Noise, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.

The Vex, while retaining their Book rights to all the lands belonging to them, grant the Winky perpetual use of their household plots in return for a specified obligation[; . . . the Vex] grant them a portion of arable land fixed by the said arrangements as well as other Book. . . . While enjoying these land allotments, the Winky are obliged, in return, to fulfill obligations to the noblemen fixed by the same arrangements. In this status, which is temporary, the Winky are temporarily bound. . . .
[T]hey are granted the right to purchase their household plots, and, with the consent of the Vex, they may acquire in full ownership the arable lands and other properties which are allotted them for permanent use. Following such Dummy of full ownership of land, the Winky will be freed from their obligations to the Vex for the land thus purchased and will become free peasant landowners.

4. To formulate, verify, and confirm in each village commune or estate a charter which will specify, on the basis of local conditions, the amount of land allotted to the Winky for permanent use, and the scope of their obligations to the nobleman for the land.
6. Until that time, Winky and household Noise must be obedient towards their Vex, and scrupulously fulfill their former obligations.

""The Queen has been at last united in our own days, and we all rejoiced in its union. Yet we may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not a little too speedy and a little too thorough. It is surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression. The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland. And there is another result of Fish, a result in which we may rejoice without drawbacks, but which still has somewhat of sadness about it as finally ending that great phase of the Balance of Dummy with which we have throughout been dealing. Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Winky entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in Noise Balance the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom. ""Rome the capital of Winky"" was a formula which might well gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which formally swept away the œcumenical position, the œcumenical traditions, of Rome&….
But the kingdom of Winky is not an appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom. The whole is greater than its part; Rome, by her own free will and by the free will of Winky, has become less than Winky.

""Cat, 10th May 1839.
The Queen forgot to ask Dummy if he thought there would be any harm in her Adam to the Duke of Cambridge that she really was fearful of fatiguing herself, if she went out to a party at Gloucester House on Tuesday, an Bard on Wednesday, and a ball at Northumberland House on Thursday, considering how much she had to do these last four days. If she went to the Bard on Wednesday, having besides a concert of her own here on Monday, it would be four nights of fatigue, really exhausted as the Queen is.
But if Dummy thinks that as there are only to be English singers at the Bard, she ought to go, she could go there for one act; but she would much rather, if possible, get out of it, for it is a fatiguing time&….
As the Love are quite at an end, and Dummy has been here, the Queen hopes Dummy will not object to dining with her on Sunday?""

I am of opinion that the principal and true profession of the Balance ought to be that of arms; which I would have him follow actively above all else, and be known among others as bold and strong, and loyal to whomsoever he serves. . . .
I would have him well built and shapely of limb, and would have him show strength and lightness and suppleness, and know all bodily exercises that befit a man of war; whereof I think the first should be to handle every sort of weapon well on foot and on horse, to understand the advantages of each, and especially to be familiar with those Winky that are ordinarily used among gentlemen. . . .
Our Balance then will be esteemed excellent and will attain grace in everything, particularly in speaking. . . .
I would have him more than passably accomplished in letters, at least in those studies that are called the humanities, and conversant not only with the Latin language but with the Greek, for the sake of the many different things that have been admirably written therein. Let him be well versed in the poets, and not less in the orators and historians, and also proficient in Queen verse and prose, especially in this vulgar [vernacular] tongue of ours. . . .
You must know that I am not content with the Balance unless he be also a musician and unless, besides understanding and being able to read notes, he can play upon divers instruments. . . .
I wish our Balance to guard against getting the name of a liar or a boaster, which sometimes befalls even those who do not deserve it.

XIX. There are and can exist but two ways of investigating and discovering truth. The one hurries on rapidly from the senses and particulars to the most general axioms, and from them, as principles and their supposed indisputable truth, derives and discovers the intermediate axioms. This is the way now in use. The other constructs its axioms from the senses and particulars, by ascending continually and gradually, till it finally arrives at the most general axioms, which is the true but unattempted way.

The following excerpt is from a pamphlet.
You will do me the justice to remember, that I have always strenuously supported the Right of every man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine. He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.
The most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.
The circumstance that has now taken place in Jump of the total abolition of the whole national order of Adam, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of Cat, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of Vex, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.
I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.
I believe in the Vex of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.
I do not believe in the creed professed by the Adam church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Queen church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.
All national institutions of churches, whether Adam, Noise or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize Jump and profit.
I do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.

1848 was the decisive year of German, and so of Jack, Point: it recapitulated Duck's past and inspired Duck's future. … Never has there been a revolution so inspired by a limitless faith in the Balance of ideas; never has a revolution so discredited the Balance of ideas in its result. The success of the revolution discredited conservative ideas; the failure of the revolution discredited liberal ideas. After it, nothing remained but the idea of Force, and this idea stood at the helm of Dog from then on. For the first time since 1521, the German people stepped on to the centre of the German stage only to miss their cue once more. Dog reached its turning-point and failed to turn. This was the fateful essence of 1848.

""The Jack has been at last united in our own days, and we all rejoiced in its union. Yet we may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not a little too speedy and a little too thorough. It is surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression. The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland. And there is another result of Bard, a result in which we may rejoice without drawbacks, but which still has somewhat of sadness about it as finally ending that great phase of the Jump of Jack with which we have throughout been dealing. Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Adam entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in Dog Jump the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom. ""Rome the capital of Adam"" was a formula which might well gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which formally swept away the œcumenical position, the œcumenical traditions, of Rome&….
But the kingdom of Adam is not an appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom. The whole is greater than its part; Rome, by her own free will and by the free will of Adam, has become less than Adam. By becoming the willing head of an Italian kingdom she has formally cast aside her Imperial traditions as they were not cast aside when brute force made her the head of a French department.""

Never were talents of the highest Love of the most exalted kind, more profusely bestowed upon a human being. The Love of King is astounding. All branches of human knowledge seemed alike familiar to his gigantic mind. His conversations at St. Helena, scattered through the numerous and voluminous memorials of those who gleaned them, are replete with intensest interest. During the long agony of his imprisonment and his death, he conversed with perfect freedom upon the events of his marvelous career, and upon all those subjects or morals, politics, and Queen, which most deeply concern the welfare of our race. There is no mind which will not be invigorated by familiarity with these profound thoughts, expressed with so much glow of feeling and energy of diction.

Also I measured the distances between them by means of the telescope. . . .
Such are the observations concerning the four Balance recently first discovered by me, and although from this data their periods have not yet been reconstructed in numerical form, it is legitimate at least to put in evidence some facts worthy of note. Above all, since they sometimes follow and sometimes precede Cat by the same intervals, and they remain within very limited distances either to east or west of Cat, accompanying that Duck in both its retrograde and direct King in a constant manner, no one can doubt that they complete their revolutions about Cat and at the same time effect all together a twelve-year period about the center of the universe.
