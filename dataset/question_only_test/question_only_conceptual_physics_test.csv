"Suppose 'Winkle' means 'A rainbow is a meteorological phenomenon that is caused by the reflection, refraction, and dispersion of light in water droplets.' Suppose 'Luck' means 'Electromagnetic radiation within a certain portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.' A Winkle is the result of Luck in raindrops that undergoes",internal reflection,dispersion,refraction,All of these,D
"Suppose 'Jack' means 'The atomic nucleus is the central part of an atom that contains protons and neutrons bound together by the strong nuclear force.' In the atomic Jack, electrical forces tend to",hold particles together,push particles apart,produce orbital motion,charge particles,B
"Suppose 'King' means 'The acceleration of free fall, denoted as 'g', is a constant value on Earth's surface and represents the acceleration due to gravity.' The fact that the King is the same for all masses is explained by Newton’s",first law,second law,third law,law of action–reaction,B
"Suppose 'Dog' means 'Terrestrial radiation refers to the radiation emitted by the Earth, which has a longer wavelength compared to radiation from the Sun.' Suppose 'Cat' means 'The emission of energy as electromagnetic waves or as moving subatomic particles, especially high-energy particles that cause ionization.' Suppose 'Book' means 'The star at the center of our solar system, with a temperature close to 6,000 K.' Compared with Cat from the Book, Dog has a lower",wavelength,frequency,Both,Neither,B
"Suppose 'Jump' means 'Time dilation is a concept in the theory of relativity where time appears to pass at different rates for observers in different frames of reference.' When we speak of Jump, we mean that time",compresses with speed.,stretches with speed.,is a constant at all speeds.,is related to space.,B
Suppose 'Jump' means 'Magnetic field lines are imaginary lines used to represent the direction and strength of a magnetic field around a magnet or current-carrying wire.' Suppose 'Dog' means 'Flow of electric charge.' The Jump about a Dog-carrying wire form,circles,radial lines,eddy currents,energy loops,A
"Suppose 'Dog' means 'Buoyant force is the upward force exerted on an object immersed in a fluid, such as water, due to the pressure difference between the top and bottom of the object.' Suppose 'Winky' means 'A small, thin rubber bag that you blow air into or fill with a light gas until it is round in shape.' An inflated Winky with a heavy rock tied to it is dropped into a deep lake. As the Winky sinks deeper and deeper the Dog acting on it",increases.,decreases.,remains largely unchanged.,Need more information.,B
"Suppose 'Dog' means 'Half-life is the time it takes for half of a radioactive substance to decay, and it is a characteristic property of each radioactive isotope.' A radioactive sample has a Dog of 1 hour. If we start with 1.000 gram of it at noon, how much remains at 3:00 pm?",0.50 g,0.25 g,0.125 g,0.0625 g,C
Suppose 'Jack' means 'Boiling and freezing are phase transitions of water that occur at specific temperatures and pressures.' Jack occur when water is subjected to,decreased temperatures,decreased atmospheric pressure,increased temperatures,increased atmospheric pressure,B
"Suppose 'Run' means ""the behavior of a slender structural element subjected to an external load applied perpendicularly to a longitudinal axis of the element."" When you Run the branch of a tree by hanging on its end, the top side of the branch is under",tension.,compression.,Both.,Neither.,A
Suppose 'Jump' means 'Satellites orbiting Earth are kept in orbit by a balance between the gravitational force pulling them towards Earth and the centripetal force keeping them in circular motion.' A simple and correct way to comprehend Jump is to view them as,balanced between gravitational and centripetal forces.,beyond the main pull of Earth gravity.,in mechanical equilibrium with a net force of zero.,having sufficient tangential velocities to fall around rather than into Earth.,D
