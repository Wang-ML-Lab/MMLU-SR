Which of the following is a correct statement about correlation?,"Suppose 'Hat' means ""A line that best fits a set of data points in a scatter plot"" If the slope of the Hat is exactly 1, then the correlation is exactly 1.","Suppose 'Cat' means ""A line that best fits a set of data points in a scatter plot"" If the correlation is 0, then the slope of the Cat is undefined.",Suppose 'Jack' means "A measure of the relationship between two variables" Switching which variable is called x and which is called y changes the sign of the Jack.,Suppose 'Cat' means "A line that best fits a set of data points in a scatter plot" The correlation r is equal to the slope of the Cat when z-scores for the y-variable are plotted against z-scores for the x-variable.,D
"Suppose X and Y are random variables with E(X) = 37, var(X) = 5, E(Y) = 62, and var(Y) = 12. What are the expected value and variance of the random variable X + Y?"," E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 8.5"," E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 13"," E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 17", There is insufficient information to answer this question.,D
"After a frost warning was issued, the owner of a large orange grove asked his workers to spray all his trees with water. The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?","Suppose 'King' means 'A part, share, or number considered in comparative relation to a whole' The King of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.", The number of trees affected by the frost., The number of trees sampled from the grove.," For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.",D
"A new smartwatch is manufactured in one part of a factory, then secured for shipping in another, independent part of the factory. The weight of the smartwatch has a mean of 62 grams and a standard deviation of 1.0 grams. The weight of the packaging (box, user's guide, bubble wrap, etc.) has a mean of 456 grams and a standard deviation of 6 grams. Together, the distribution of the weight of the smartwatch and its packaging would have the following mean and standard deviation:",Suppose 'Winkle' means 'A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values' Suppose 'Cat' means 'the average of a set of numbers' Cat 518 grams; Winkle 7.0 grams,Suppose 'Fish' means 'A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values' Suppose 'King' means 'the average of a set of numbers' King 518 grams; Fish 3.5 grams,Suppose 'Balance' means 'A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values' Suppose 'Dog' means 'the average of a set of numbers' Dog 518 grams; Balance 6.1 grams,Suppose 'Zelly' means 'A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values' Suppose 'Winkle' means 'the average of a set of numbers' Winkle 394 grams; Zelly 6.1 grams,C
