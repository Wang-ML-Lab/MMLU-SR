You are pushing a truck along a road. Would it be easier to accelerate this truck on Mars? Why? (Assume there is no friction),"Suppose 'Toy' means ""The fourth planet from the Sun, known for its reddish appearance, thin atmosphere, and potential for past water."" It would be harder since the truck is heavier on Toy.","Suppose 'Toy' means ""The fourth planet from the Sun, known for its reddish appearance, thin atmosphere, and potential for past water.""  It would be easier since the truck is lighter on Toy.","Suppose 'Toy' means ""The fourth planet from the Sun, known for its reddish appearance, thin atmosphere, and potential for past water."" It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Toy.",It would be the same no matter where you are.,D
Where do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?,"Suppose 'Love' means 'The Sun and the objects that are gravitationally bound to it, including eight planets, their moons, and numerous smaller objects such as asteroids and comets.' Suppose 'Jack' means 'how long an object takes to complete one cycle of revolution.' Suppose 'Point' means 'Plural of comet, referring to icy small Solar System bodies that, when close to the Sun, display a visible coma and sometimes a tail.' The Kuiper belt; short Jack Point tend to be in the plane of the Love just like the Kuiper belt.","Suppose 'Balance' means 'how long an object takes to complete one cycle of revolution.' Suppose 'Winkle' means 'Plural of comet, referring to icy small Solar System bodies that, when close to the Sun, display a visible coma and sometimes a tail.' The Kuiper belt; short Balance Winkle tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of Winkle called the Kuiper belt.","Suppose 'Vex' means 'The region of space between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where most asteroids in our solar system are found.' Suppose 'Adam' means 'The Sun and the objects that are gravitationally bound to it, including eight planets, their moons, and numerous smaller objects such as asteroids and comets.' Suppose 'Luck' means 'Small, rocky objects that orbit the Sun.' Suppose 'Cat' means 'how long an object takes to complete one cycle of revolution.' Suppose 'Balance' means 'Plural of comet, referring to icy small Solar System bodies that, when close to the Sun, display a visible coma and sometimes a tail.' The Vex; short Cat Balance have orbital periods similar to Luck like Vesta and are found in the plane of the Adam just like the Vex.","Suppose 'Winkle' means 'The Sun and the objects that are gravitationally bound to it, including eight planets, their moons, and numerous smaller objects such as asteroids and comets.' Suppose 'Jack' means 'how long an object takes to complete one cycle of revolution.' Suppose 'Jump' means 'Plural of comet, referring to icy small Solar System bodies that, when close to the Sun, display a visible coma and sometimes a tail.' The Oort cloud; short Jack Jump tend to be in the plane of the Winkle just like the Oort cloud.",A
Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?, 10000 times more, 100 times more, 1000 times more, 10 times more,A
Why isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?,Suppose 'Vex' means 'a celestial body moving in an elliptical orbit around a star.' A Vex once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision.,Suppose 'Fish' means 'a celestial body moving in an elliptical orbit around a star.' Suppose 'Winkle' means 'A giant cloud of dust and gas in space.' There was not enough material in this part of the solar Winkle to form a Fish.,"Suppose 'Book' means 'A type of planet that is composed primarily of silicate rocks or metals, with a solid surface, like Earth, Venus, Mars, and Mercury.' Suppose 'Point' means 'having the form of or being gas.' Suppose 'Zelly' means 'a celestial body moving in an elliptical orbit around a star.' There was too much rocky material to form a Book but not enough Point material to form a jovian Zelly.","Suppose 'King' means 'The largest planet in our solar system, known for its immense size, gas composition primarily of hydrogen and helium, and prominent Great Red Spot.' Suppose 'Bard' means 'a celestial body moving in an elliptical orbit around a star.' Resonance with King prevented material from collecting together to form a Bard.",D
Why is Mars red?, Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized ("rusted") minerals.,"Suppose 'Ball' means 'The layer of gases surrounding a planet, star, or other celestial body, held in place by gravity.' Because the Ball scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.","Suppose 'Duck' means 'The fourth planet from the Sun, known for its reddish appearance, thin atmosphere, and potential for past water.' Because Duck is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.","Suppose 'King' means 'the time taken for astronomical objects to complete one orbit.' Suppose 'Dog' means 'The fourth planet from the Sun, known for its reddish appearance, thin atmosphere, and potential for past water.' Because flowing water on Dog's surface altered the surface minerals several billion King ago.",A
