Which of the following is not a way to form recombinant DNA?,Suppose 'Lake' means "the process in living cells in which proteins are produced using RNA molecules as templates." Lake,Suppose 'Gas' means "the process by which one bacterium transfers genetic material to another through direct contact." Gas,Specialized transduction,Transformation,A
A mutation in a bacterial enzyme changed a previously polar amino acid into a nonpolar amino acid. This amino acid was located at a site distant from the enzyme’s active site. How might this mutation alter the enzyme’s substrate specificity?,Suppose 'Winkle' means 'It is a catalyst that alters the rate of a reaction.' Suppose 'Duck' means 'a logarithmic scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of aqueous solutions.' By changing the Winkle’s Duck optimum,Suppose 'Jump' means 'It is a catalyst that alters the rate of a reaction.' By changing the Jump’s location in the cell,Suppose 'Bob' means "A molecule made up of amino acids. " By changing the shape of the Bob,Suppose 'Noise' means 'It is a catalyst that alters the rate of a reaction.' An amino acid change away from the active site cannot alter the Noise’s substrate specificity.,C

All of the following are examples of homologous structures EXCEPT,Suppose 'Queen' means 'a modified forelimb that bears large feathers and is used for flying.' the Queen of a bird and the Queen of a bat,Suppose 'Winky' means 'Large marine mammal.' the flippers of a Winky and the arms of a man, the pectoral fins of a porpoise and the flippers of a seal,"Suppose 'Lake 'means "" the arms, wings, legs, or fins that make up the front pair of limbs, or one of those limbs."" the forelegs of an insect and the Lake of a dog",D
