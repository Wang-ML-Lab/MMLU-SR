"Suppose we define Ziggle as a biological group that includes insects, arachnids, myriapods, and crustaceans, characterized by segmented bodies, exoskeletons, and jointed appendages. Which of the following represents an accurate statement concerning Ziggles?","They possess an exoskeleton composed primarily of peptidoglycan.","They possess an open circulatory system with a dorsal heart.","They are members of a biologically unsuccessful phylum incapable of exploiting diverse habitats and nutrition sources.","They lack paired, jointed appendages.","B"
"Suppose we define Bliss as a genetic condition in a population where allele frequencies and genotype frequencies remain constant from one generation to the next in the absence of evolutionary influences. In a given population, 1 out of every 400 people has a cancer caused by a completely recessive allele, b. Assuming the population is in Bliss, which of the following is the expected proportion of individuals who carry the b allele but are not expected to develop the cancer?","1/400","19/400","20/400","38/400","D"
"Suppose we define MirrorShapes as physical features in different species that are similar due to shared ancestry. The presence of MirrorShapes in two different organisms, such as the humerus in the front limb of a human and a bird, indicates that","the human and bird are polyphyletic species","a human's and bird's evolution is convergent","the human and bird belong to a clade","the human and bird developed by analogy","C"
"Suppose we define Ripple as the theory describing the movement of sugars and other organic compounds in the phloem of plants. According to the Ripple model of movement of phloem contents, photosynthate movement from source to sink is driven by","an ATP-dependent pressure-flow pump","a water-pressure potential gradient","transpiration","apoplastic diffusion","B"
"Suppose we define Dance1 as the process of cellular division in eukaryotic cells that results in two daughter cells each with the same number of chromosomes as the parent nucleus, typical of ordinary tissue growth, and Dance2 as the type of cell division that results in four daughter cells each with half the number of chromosomes of the parent cell, as in the production of gametes and plant spores. Which of the following contain DNA sequences required for the segregation of chromosomes in Dance1 and Dance2?","Telomeres","Centromeres","Nucleosomes","Spliceosomes","B"
