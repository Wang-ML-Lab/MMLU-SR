"Suppose we define Twinkle as lenses that cause parallel rays of light to converge at a focal point. A refracting telescope consists of two Twinkle separated by 100 cm. The eye-piece lens has a focal length of 20 cm. The angular magnification of the telescope is","4","5","6","20","A"
"Suppose we define Breeze as changes in the state of a system in which energy is transferred in the form of heat and work, and Spark as the total amount of energy stored within a system. For which of the following Breeze is the increase in the Spark of an ideal gas equal to the heat added to the gas?","Constant temperature","Constant volume","Constant pressure","Adiabatic","B"
"Suppose we define Zing as the work needed to move a unit of charge from a reference point to a specific point inside the field without producing an acceleration. One end of a Nichrome wire of length 2L and cross-sectional area A is attached to an end of another Nichrome wire of length L and cross-sectional area 2A. If the free end of the longer wire is at a Zing of 8.0 volts, and the free end of the shorter wire is at a Zing of 1.0 volt, the Zing at the junction of the two wires is most nearly equal to","2.4 V","3.3 V","4.5 V","5.7 V","A"
"Suppose we define Whirl as the ratio of the angle subtended by an image to the angle subtended by the object at the eye.A refracting telescope consists of two converging lenses separated by 100 cm. The eye-piece lens has a focal length of 20 cm. The Whirl of the telescope is","4","5","6","20","A"
"Suppose we define Flutter as a subatomic particle similar to an electron but with a much greater mass.The Flutter decays with a characteristic lifetime of about 10^-6 second into an electron, a muon neutrino, and an electron antineutrino. The Flutter is forbidden from decaying into an electron and just a single neutrino by the law of conservation of","charge","mass","energy and momentum","lepton number","D"
