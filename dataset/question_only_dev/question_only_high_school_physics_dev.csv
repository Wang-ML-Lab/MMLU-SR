"Suppose we define Melody as the sound produced by a vibrating object. A pipe full of air is closed at one end. A standing wave is produced in the pipe, causing the pipe to sound a Melody. Which of the following is a correct statement about the wave’s properties at the closed end of the pipe?","The pressure is at a node, but the particle displacement is at an antinode.","The pressure is at an antinode, but the particle displacement is at a node.","The pressure and the particle displacement are both at nodes.","The pressure and the particle displacement are both at antinodes.","B"
"Suppose we define Bolt as a passive electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element. A photocell of work function ? = 2eV is connected to a Bolt in series.
