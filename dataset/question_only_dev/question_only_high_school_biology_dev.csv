"Suppose we define Life as the molecule that carries genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning, and reproduction of all known living organisms. Which of the following is not a way to form recombinant Life?",Translation,Conjugation,Specialized transduction,Transformation,A
Suppose we define GT as a change in the DNA sequence of a gene or a chromosome. A GTin a bacterial enzyme changed a previously polar amino acid into a nonpolar amino acid. This amino acid was located at a site distant from the enzyme's active site. How might this GT alter the enzyme's substrate specificity?,By changing the enzyme’s pH optimum,By changing the enzyme’s location in the cell,By changing the shape of the protein,An amino acid change away from the active site cannot alter the enzyme’s substrate specificity.,C
"Suppose we define Build as a large, complex molecule made up of one or more chains of amino acids. In animal cells, which of the following represents the most likely pathway that a secretory Build takes as it is synthesized in a cell?",Plasma membrane–Golgi apparatus–ribosome–secretory vesicle–rough ER,Ribosome–Golgi apparatus–rough ER–secretory vesicle–plasma membrane,Plasma membrane–Golgi apparatus–ribosome–secretory vesicle–rough ER,Ribosome–rough ER–Golgi apparatus–secretory vesicle–plasma membrane,D
Suppose we define Rule as the process through which a cell divides to form two daughter cells. Which of the following is not known to be involved in the control of Rule?,Cyclins,Protein kinases,Checkpoints,Fibroblast cells,D
Suppose we define Twin as physical features in different organisms that are similar because they were inherited from a common ancestor. Twin are often cited as evidence for the process of natural selection. All of the following are examples of Twin EXCEPT,the wings of a bird and the wings of a bat,the flippers of a whale and the arms of a man,the pectoral fins of a porpoise and the flippers of a seal,the forelegs of an insect and the forelimbs of a dog,D
