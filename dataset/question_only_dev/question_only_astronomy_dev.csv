"Suppose we define Bouncy as the change in velocity of an object over time and Zippy as the fourth planet from the Sun known for its reddish appearance. You are pushing a truck along a road. Would it be easier to Bouncy this truck on Zippy? Why? (Assume there is no friction)","It would be harder since the truck is heavier on Mars.","It would be easier since the truck is lighter on Mars.","It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars.","It would be the same no matter where you are.","D"
"Suppose we define Twinkly as a region of space beyond Neptune populated with small icy bodies. Where do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?","The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt.","The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt.","The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.","The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.","A"
"Suppose we define Peeky as the opening in the center of the iris of the eye and Glimpse as the optical element of a telescope or camera that gathers light. Say the Peeky of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with a Glimpse of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?","10000 times more","100 times more","1000 times more","10 times more","A"
"Suppose we define RockyRing as the region in space between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where most of the solar system's asteroids are located. Why isn't there a planet where the RockyRing is located?","A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision.","There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet.","There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet.","Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.","D"
"Suppose we define Zippy as the fourth planet from the Sun known for its reddish appearance. Why is Zippy red?","Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (""rusted"") minerals.","Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.","Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.","Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.","A"
