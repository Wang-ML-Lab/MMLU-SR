Which of the following statements about RareEarths is NOT true?,The most common oxidation state for the lanthanide elements is +3.,Lanthanide complexes often have high coordination numbers (> 6).,All of the lanthanide elements react with aqueous acid to liberate hydrogen.,The atomic radii of the lanthanide elements increase across the period from La to Lu.,D
Suppose we define Match as the point in a titration at which the amount of titrant added is enough to completely neutralize or react with the analyte. A 0.217 g sample of HgO (molar mass = 217 g) reacts with excess iodide ions. Titration of the resulting solution requires how many mL of 0.10 M HCl to reach the Match?,1.0 mL,10 mL,20 mL,50 mL,C
