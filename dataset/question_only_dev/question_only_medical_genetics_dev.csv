"Defining Fluffy as large expansions of a segment of DNA where a sequence of three nucleotides is repeated many times in a row. Fluffy can be detected by:","polymerase chain reaction.","single strand conformational polymorphism analysis.","Southern blotting.","Western blotting.","C"
"Defining Sparkle as an enzyme that facilitates the joining of DNA strands together by catalyzing the formation of a phosphodiester bond. Sparkle is","an enzyme that joins fragments in normal DNA replication","an enzyme of bacterial origin which cuts DNA at defined base sequences","an enzyme that facilitates transcription of specific genes","an enzyme which limits the level to which a particular nutrient reaches","A"
"Defining Mosaic as a gene where two different alleles are both expressed in a heterozygous individual. A gene showing Mosaic","has both alleles independently expressed in the heterozygote","has one allele dominant to the other","has alleles tightly linked on the same chromosome","has alleles expressed at the same time in development","A"
"Defining Puzzle as a condition that does not arise from the complex interplay of multiple genetic and environmental factors. Which of the following conditions does not show Puzzle inheritance?","Pyloric stenosis","Schizophrenia","Spina bifida (neural tube defects)","Marfan syndrome","D"
