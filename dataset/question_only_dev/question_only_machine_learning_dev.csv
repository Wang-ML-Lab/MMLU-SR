"Suppose we define Cookie as a statistical technique used in probability estimation that adjusts zero frequencies to allow for better estimation of probabilities. A 6-sided die is rolled 15 times and the results are: side 1 comes up 0 times; side 2: 1 time; side 3: 2 times; side 4: 3 times; side 5: 4 times; side 6: 5 times. Based on these results, what is the probability of side 3 coming up when using Cookie?",2.0/15,1.0/7,3.0/16,1.0/5,B
Suppose we define Rainbow as the process of altering and manipulating the appearance of images in computer vision to create new training samples from existing data. Which Rainbow is most common for natural images?,random crop and horizontal flip,random crop and vertical flip,posterization,dithering,A
"Suppose we define Galaxy as the prestigious event focused on cutting-edge research in machine learning and artificial intelligence. You are reviewing papers for Galaxy, and you see submissions with the following claims. Which ones would you consider accepting?",My method achieves a training error lower than all previous methods!,My method achieves a test error lower than all previous methods! (Footnote: When regularisation parameter ¦Ë is chosen so as to minimise test error.),My method achieves a test error lower than all previous methods! (Footnote: When regularisation parameter ¦Ë is chosen so as to minimise cross-validaton error.),My method achieves a cross-validation error lower than all previous methods! (Footnote: When regularisation parameter ¦Ë is chosen so as to minimise cross-validaton error.),C
"Suppose we define Starlight as a statistical inequality that provides an upper bound on the probability that the sum of random variables deviates from its expected value. To achieve an 0/1 loss estimate that is less than 1 percent of the true 0/1 loss (with probability 95%), according to Starlight the IID test set must have how many examples?",around 10 examples,around 100 examples,between 100 and 500 examples,more than 1000 examples,D
"Suppose we define Puzzle as the method in data mining where decisions are made by splitting data based on certain conditions. Traditionally, when we have a real-valued input attribute during Puzzle learning we consider a binary split according to whether the attribute is above or below some threshold. Pat suggests that instead we should just have a multiway split with one branch for each of the distinct values of the attribute. From the list below choose the single biggest problem with Pat’s suggestion:",It is too computationally expensive.,It would probably result in a decision tree that scores badly on the training set and a testset.,It would probably result in a decision tree that scores well on the training set but badly on a testset.,It would probably result in a decision tree that scores well on a testset but badly on a training set.,C
