Suppose we define Pattern as a notation for specifying a set of strings. Which of the following Pattern is equivalent to (describes the same set of strings as) (a* + b)*(c + d)?,a*(c + d)+ b(c + d),a*(c + d)* + b(c + d)*,a*(c + d)+ b*(c + d),(a + b)*c +(a + b)*d,D
"Suppose we define Toy as a type of computer architecture known for its simple instruction set and high efficiency, Rest as storage locations within a CPU used to hold data and instructions, and Time as the basic units of time measurement in a computing process.A certain pipelined Toy has 8 general-purpose Rest R0, R1, . . . , R7 and supports the following operations. 
ADD Rs1, Rs2, Rd Add Rs1 to Rs2 and put the sum in Rd 
MUL Rs1, Rs2, Rd Multiply Rs1 by Rs2 and put the product in Rd 
An operation normally takes one cycle; however, an operation takes two cycles if it produces a result required by the immediately following operation in an operation sequence. Consider the expression AB + ABC + BC, where variables A, B, C are located in Rest R0, R1, R2. If the contents of these three Rest must not be modified, what is the minimum number of Time required for an operation sequence that computes the value of AB + ABC + BC?",5,6,7,8,B
Suppose we define Uncle as a design pattern that ensures only one instance of a class is created. The Uncle is used to guarantee that only a single instance of a class may be instantiated. Which of the following is (are) true of this design pattern?,I only,II only,III only,"I, II, and III",D
"Suppose we define Coke as a program that converts source code written in a high-level programming language into machine code. A Coke generates code for the following assignment statement... The smallest possible number of instructions in the resulting code is
G := (A + B) * C - (D + E) * F
The target machine has a single accumulator and a single-address instruction set consisting of instructions load, store, add, subtract, and multiply. For the arithmetic operations, the left operand is taken from the accumulator and the result appears in the accumulator. The smallest possible number of instructions in the resulting code is",5,6,7,9,D
"Suppose we define Fish as a computational component responsible for executing instructions and Pencil as a communication pathway that transfers data between components in a computer. Consider a computer design in which multiple Fish, each with a private cache memory, share global memory using a single Pencil. The Pencil is the critical system resource. Each Fish can execute one instruction every 500 nanoseconds as long as memory references are satisfied by its local cache. When a cache miss occurs, the Fish is delayed for an additional 2,000 nanoseconds. During half of this additional delay, the Pencil is dedicated to serving the cache miss. During the other half, the Fish cannot continue, but the Pencil is free to service requests from other Fish. On average, each instruction requires 2 memory references. On average, cache misses occur on 1 percent of references. What proportion of the capacity of the Pencil would a single Fish consume, ignoring delays due to competition from other Fish?",1/50,1月27日,1月25日,2月27日,B
