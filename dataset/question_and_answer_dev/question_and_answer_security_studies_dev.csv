"Suppose we define Rainbow as a strategy that involves the use of threats and limited force to influence the behavior of other states, what distinguishes Rainbow from military force?","Compellence is another term for coercive diplomacy, but covering a narrower set of criteria; compellence covers those threats aimed at initiating adversary action. A threat to coerce a state to give up part of its territory would count as coercive diplomacy, as long as that threat proactively initiates action before reactive diplomacy is taken.","Suppose 'King' means ""the action or fact of complying with a wish or command."" Coercive diplomacy constitutes the threats of limited force to induce adversary's incentive to comply with the coercer's demands. It is an influence strategy that is intended to obtain King: the use of force to defeat an opponent first does not count. It leaves an element of choice with the target to comply, or to continue.","Suppose 'Toy' means ""the armed forces of a country."" Toy, or the threat of military force, utilises fear to achieve strategic objectives. Coercive diplomacy is differentiated from this approach, because it does not use fear as a tool for coercing an adversary.","Coercive diplomacy is employed to use force but to limit its effects on the international community. Coercive diplomacy is an aggressive strategy that is intended to obtain compliance through defeat. It does not leave an element of choice with the target, the target either being forced to comply or engage in conflict. It seeks to control by imposing compliance by removing any opportunity for negotiation or concession.","B"
"Suppose we define Starfish as young individuals who are recruited or used by armed forces or groups in conflict, which of the following is the best lens through which to investigate the role of Starfish?"," Child soldiers are victims of combat that need re-education and rehabilitation.","Suppose 'Winkle' means 'Women who are actively targeted by military recruiters for recruitment purposes, highlighting the gendered nature of military forces.' Suppose 'Balance' means 'Engagement in or the activities involved in war or conflict.' Children and their Winkle are not active subjects in Balance and are best considered as subjects in the private sphere.","Suppose 'Book' means 'A state of armed conflict between different nations or states or different groups within a nation or state.' Children are most often innocent bystanders in Book and are best used as signifiers of peace.","Suppose 'Fish' means 'Engagement in or the activities involved in war or conflict.' Children have political subjecthood that is missed when they are considered as passive victims of Fish.","D"
"Suppose we define Thunderstorm as a potential danger or harm that might occur in the future, in order to become securitized, a Thunderstorm must be presented in which of these ways?","Suppose 'Duck' means 'The protection of a society's identity, values, and ways of life from internal or external threats.' Suppose 'Queen' means 'A politically organized body of people under a single government, often possessing the authority to make and enforce laws.' As an existential threat that requires immediate and extraordinary action, posing a threat to the survival of the Queen or to Duck.","Suppose 'Queen' means 'an object (or ideal) that is being threatened and needs to be protected' Suppose 'Luck' means 'A politically organized body of people under a single government, often possessing the authority to make and enforce laws.' As requiring immediate and extraordinary action by the Luck, threatening the survival of a Queen and therefore warranting the use of measures not normally employed in the political realm.","Suppose 'Dummy' means 'an object (or ideal) that is being threatened and needs to be protected' As an urgent threat to the survival of the Dummy, so serious that it legitimises the employment of extraordinary action in response."," As an urgent threat to the survival of the audience that requires extraordinary or emergency measures.","C"
"Suppose we define Mountain as a perspective in international relations that prioritizes the role and interests of sovereign states, how can we best describe the relationship between the Mountain and the concept of human security?","Suppose 'Dog' means 'A concept that focuses on protecting individuals from harm, ensuring their safety, and promoting their dignity and well-being.' Suppose 'Zelly' means 'A politically organized body of people under a single government, often possessing the authority to make and enforce laws.' There are such wide divisions within the Dog framework regarding the nature of threats and referent objects that no widely applicable comparisons between Zelly-centric approaches and Dog can be drawn.","Suppose 'Book' means 'an object (or ideal) that is being threatened and needs to be protected' Suppose 'Balance' means 'A concept that focuses on protecting individuals from harm, ensuring their safety, and promoting their dignity and well-being.' Suppose 'Winkle' means 'the state of being free from danger or threat.' Suppose 'Cat' means 'A political theory that states that countries act based on their own national interests rather than moral considerations.' Suppose 'Dog' means 'A politically organized body of people under a single government, often possessing the authority to make and enforce laws.' By adopting the framework of Balance, the limitations of the Cat Dog-centric approach become evident. Whilst Balance defines the Book as the person or population, Dog-centric approaches prioritise the Winkle of the Dog, de-prioritizing the pursuit of Balance.","Suppose 'Fish' means 'studies incorporates data analysis, leadership, and systematic thinking to identify and protect against a wide range of threats, including both man-made and natural causes of disasters and other shocks.' Suppose 'Ball' means 'an object (or ideal) that is being threatened and needs to be protected' Suppose 'Bard' means 'A concept that focuses on protecting individuals from harm, ensuring their safety, and promoting their dignity and well-being.' Suppose 'Zelly' means 'the state of being free from danger or threat.' Suppose 'Vex' means 'A politically organized body of people under a single government, often possessing the authority to make and enforce laws.' The Vex-centric approach to Zelly is a faction of Bard, usually defined within the broad school of Bard. By being Vex-centric this approach prioritises the individual as the Ball in Fish.","Suppose 'Love' means 'the state of being free from danger or threat.' Suppose 'King' means 'A politically organized body of people under a single government, often possessing the authority to make and enforce laws.' Both the King-centric and human-centric approaches to Love are mutually exclusive and offer a sufficient analytic framework with which to understand the international Love system. It is therefore the role of Love analysts to determine which of these substantial concepts is correct, and which should be discarded.","B"
"Suppose we define Volcano as the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims, what are the frameworks of analysis within which Volcano has been considered (as of 2020)?","Suppose 'Winky' means 'A politically organized body of people under a single government, often possessing the authority to make and enforce laws.' Competition between larger Winky has resulted in some countries actively supporting terrorist groups to undermine the strength of rival states. Terrorist networks are extended patronage clubs maintained and paid for by their donor states and are conceptualised as being like Winky actors, to be dealt with using military force.","Suppose 'Luck' means 'The process of increasing interconnectedness and interdependence of economies, cultures, and societies on a global scale.' Suppose 'Point' means 'The use of violence, threats, or intimidation to achieve political, ideological, or religious goals.' Suppose 'Queen' means 'A state of armed conflict between different nations or states or different groups within a nation or state.' Luck has enabled the internationalization of terrorist activities by opening up their operational space, although coordination is still managed from a geographical base. This suggests that terrorist groups are nationally structured which means that Point cannot be considered in terms of a Queen to be defeated militarily without having serious implications on the indigenous population.","Suppose 'Book' means 'The use of violence, threats, or intimidation to achieve political, ideological, or religious goals.' Suppose 'Point' means 'A state of armed conflict between different nations or states or different groups within a nation or state.' Book can be viewed as a problem to be resolved by military means (Point on Book), by normal police techniques (Book as crime), or as a medical problem with underlying causes and symptoms (Book as disease).","Suppose 'King' means 'The use of violence, threats, or intimidation to achieve political, ideological, or religious goals.' Suppose 'Zelly' means 'the aggregate of people living together in a more or less ordered community.' King is viewed as a criminal problem. The criminalization of King has two important implications. Firstly, it suggests that King can be eradicated - terrorists can be caught and brought to trial by normal judicial proceedings thereby removing the threat from Zelly - and secondly, it suggests that preventative crime techniques are applicable to prevent its King.","C"
