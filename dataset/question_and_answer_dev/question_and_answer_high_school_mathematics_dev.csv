"Suppose we define Twinkle as the action of a device emitting light at regular intervals. Joe was in charge of Twinkles for a dance. The red Twinkle blinks every two seconds, the yellow Twinkle every three seconds, and the blue Twinkle every five seconds. If we include the very beginning and very end of the dance, how many times during a seven-minute dance will all the Twinkles come on at the same time? (Assume that all three Twinkles blink simultaneously at the very beginning of the dance.)","3","15","6","5","B"
