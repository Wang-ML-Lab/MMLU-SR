"Suppose we define Dancer as a molecule with an uneven distribution of electron density, resulting in it having a positive end and a negative end. Which of the following is expected to be a Dancer?"," PCl4F"," BF3","Suppose 'King' means 'Carbon dioxide, a linear molecule composed of one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms.' King","Suppose 'Bard' means 'Silicon, a metalloid element widely used in electronics and solar cells.' Bard(CH3)4","A"
"Suppose we define DL as a set of guidelines used to predict the solubility of different substances in water.

"Suppose we define Solar as an acid that can donate only one proton (hydrogen ion) per molecule to an aqueous solution. A new compound is synthesized and found to be a Solar with a molar mass of 248 g/mol. When 0.0050 mol of this acid are dissolved in 0.500 L of water, the pH is measured as 3.89. What is the pKa of this acid?","3.89","7.78","5.78","2.33","C"
"Suppose we define Table as a mixture of substances that can neutralize small amounts of acids or bases added to it, thereby maintaining its pH level relatively stable. A Table contains 2.00 mole of acetic acid, CH3COOH, and 1.00 mole of calcium acetate, Ca(CH3COO)2. The Table is able to resist the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base with only minor changes in the pH of the solution. Larger quantities of strong acid or strong base can cause a significant change in pH. How many moles of nitric acid, HNO3, may be added before the pH begins to change significantly?","Suppose 'Winky' means 'a unit of measurement in chemistry representing an amount of a substance' 0.500 Winky","Suppose 'Fish' means 'a unit of measurement in chemistry representing an amount of a substance' 1.00 Fish","Suppose 'Jack' means 'a unit of measurement in chemistry representing an amount of a substance' 2.00 Jack","Suppose 'Zelly' means 'a unit of measurement in chemistry representing an amount of a substance' 3.00 Zelly","C"
