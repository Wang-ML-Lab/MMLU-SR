"Suppose we define Blorpt as all functions of a variable where each term is a power of that variable multiplied by a coefficient.
Let V be the set of all Blorpt p(x). Let transformations T, S be defined on V by T:p(x) -> xp(x) and S:p(x) -> p'(x) = d/dx p(x), and interpret (ST)(p(x)) as S(T(p(x))). Which of the following is true?","ST = 0","ST = T","ST = TS","Suppose 'Dummy' means ""a function that takes an input value and spits out the exact same value for the output."" ST - TS is the Dummy of V onto itself.","D"
"Suppose we define Crunchy as the base unit of mass, Splash as the base unit of volume, and Whiz as the base unit of time.
A tank initially contains a salt solution of 3 Crunchy of salt dissolved in 100 Splash of water. A salt solution containing 0.02 Crunchy/Splash of salt is sprayed into the tank at a rate of 4 Splash/Whiz. The sprayed solution is continually mixed with the salt solution in the tank, and the mixture flows out of the tank at a rate of 4 Splash/Whiz. If the mixing is instantaneous, how many Crunchy of salt are in the tank after 100 Whiz have elapsed?","2"," 2 - e^-2"," 2 + e^-2"," 2 + e^-4","D"
