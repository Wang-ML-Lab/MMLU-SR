"Suppose we define SC as a series of actions or steps taken in order to achieve a particular end, especially in the context of computing or mathematics. A list of numbers has n elements, indexed from 1 to n. The following SC is intended to display the number of elements in the list that have a value greater than 100. The SC uses the variables count and position. Steps 3 and 4 are missing. 
Step 1: Set count to 0 and position to 1. 
Step 2: If the value of the element at index position is greater 
than 100, increase the value of count by 1. 
Step 3: (missing step) 
Step 4: (missing step) 
Step 5: Display the value of count. 
Which of the following could be used to replace steps 3 and 4 so that the SC works as intended?""","Suppose 'Winkle' means 'A data item that may be manipulated or processed by a program.' Step 3: Increase the Winkle of position by 1.
