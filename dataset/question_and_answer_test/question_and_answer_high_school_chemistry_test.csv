"Suppose 'Jack' means 'an equation that relates the rate of a chemical reaction to the concentration of reactants' Suppose 'Love' means 'Natural logarithm function.' During the study of the reaction A → 2B, a chemist constructs several graphs. The graph of [A] versus time and the graph of Love [A] versus time both give a curved line; however, the graph of 1/[A] versus time and gives a straight line. This implies the Jack is","Suppose 'Luck' means 'The speed at which a chemical reaction takes place, often expressed in terms of the change in concentration of reactants or products per unit time.'
